There is evidence that several avermectins inhibit the hepatic stage of Plasmodium infection in vitro. Notably, ivermectin potently inhibits liver infection in vivo by impairing parasite development inside hepatocytes. This impairment has a clear impact on the ensuing blood stage parasitemia, reducing disease severity and enhancing host survival. Ivermectin has been proposed as a tool to control malaria transmission because of its effects on the mosquito vector. This study extends the effect of ivermectin to the early stages of mammalian host infection and supports the inclusion of this multipurpose drug in malaria control strategies.

This poses a serious threat to reaching elimination goals. Mass administration of ivermectin (a drug capable of targeting malaria vectors regardless of time and place of biting) has gained increased attention by funders, academia and international organizations as a potential complementary tool for malaria elimination. There is now clear WHO guidance on the Preferred Product Characteristics for such a tool and a draft Target Candidate Profile by Medicines for Malaria Venture.  Still, the malaria community lacks alignment on the processes needed to transform the potential of ivermectin into an implemented tool. This project aims at producing a roadmap for such transformation including key issues to be resolved (dose, regimen, eligibility, regulatory pathway), go/no-go criteria along the evaluation and development process. For this, the ivermectin taskforce, a group of experts and stakeholders will work on complementary streams to produce a roadmap document and accompanying TPPs that can guide related investments and efforts.

Endectocide use in livestock as a tool to help eliminate malaria in Central America,https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9245228&icde=35858735&ddparam=&ddvalue=&ddsub=&cr=19&csb=default&cs=ASC&pball,Project,Jan-17,Dec-18,,$139 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,University of North Dakota,Jefferson Vaughan,,"Malaria is a major health problem throughout the tropical world and is transmitted by a variety of Anopheles mosquitoes. Core vector control interventions consist of indoor residual spraying of insecticides and long- lasting insecticidal nets. These are logical strategies in areas where the primary vector species feed at night on people sleeping in their houses and where mosquitoes rest inside the house after blood-feeding. But in Central America, much of the malaria transmission is due to malaria vectors that are exophagic (i.e., prefer to bite outdoors), exophilic (i.e., prefer to remain outdoors), and zoophaghic (i.e., as likely to feed on non-humans as humans). To control mosquitoes with these behavioral characteristics requires a different approach. This proposal addresses the control of zoophagic vectors. Endectocides are chemicals that are widely used in the livestock industry to control parasites such as intestinal nematodes, ticks, mange mites, lice, and cattle grub. When ingested by mosquitoes in a bloodmeal, endectocides have also been shown to reduce the survival and fecundity of Anopheles malaria vectors. Use of endectocides in peridomestic livestock may simultaneously hasten malaria eradication, control ticks, and boost feed-conversion for livestock in Central America. 
","Targeted use of endectocides (such as ivermectin) in peridomestic livestock can significantly reduce the survival and longevity of zoophagic Anopheles vectors that feed on treated cattle. Because zoophagic vectors are responsible for much of the malaria transmission in Central America, malaria transmission will be reduced in areas where endectocides are given to livestock.
This proposal will determine if endectocides, when administered to cattle, reduces the survival and fecundity of zoophagic malaria vectors in Central America.",Entomology,"Drug-based strategies, Tools for elimination"
An oral ultra long-acting ivermectin for malaria elimination,https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9346996&icde=35858735&ddparam=&ddvalue=&ddsub=&cr=1&csb=default&cs=ASC&pball=,Project,Aug-17,Jan-18,United States,$1 047 601,"National Center For Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), NIH",,,"Lyndra, Inc",Andrew M. Bellinger,,"Despite effective treatments, malaria remains a scourge of sub-Saharan Africa. Additional interventions beyond those currently available are needed to eliminate the disease. One strategy with increasing support is addition of ivermectin, a well-known and safe drug used for treating onchocerciasis and other diseases, to current mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns with artemisinin regimens. Ivermectin has a unique activity in interrupting malaria transmission in endemic areas by reducing the life expectancy of the vector Anopheles mosquitos that bite subjects who have ivermectin in their blood. Modelling, as well as proof of concept field studies, have shown that long (10 plus day) courses of small doses of ivermectin, in combination with short courses of currently used artemisinin combination MDA, have the potential to reduce the efficiency of malaria transmission, reduce malaria cases, and potentially lead to disease elimination. Treating even 50% of the population in this way can reduce disease transmission to levels that can protect the whole population, including children under 5 most at risk. To be effective, repeat dosing every three days would currently be necessary, limiting feasibility. Development of an ultra long-acting oral ivermectin formulation that achieves single dose administration and prolonged low level blood exposure could dramatically change current treatment options, reduce malaria morbidity and potentiate malaria elimination efforts. No existing oral delivery system can prolong therapeutic blood levels for small molecules therapeutics beyond 12-24 hours. Prototype oral capsules based on Lyndra's gastric residence technology have been developed, and can achieve 7-14 days of sustained therapeutic ivermectin levels in a pig model and have shown similar efficacy with other drugs in multiple large animal models.
","The goal of this grant is to develop an optimal ivermectin dosage form that 1) achieves consistent and efficacious blood levels of ivermectin for 14 days from a single dose administration, 2) develop a reproducible and scalable low cost manufacturing capability, and 3) evaluate these dosage forms with respect to pharmacokinetics and gastric retention in beagle dogs. Formulations will be developed to pharmaceutical grade standards of in vitro release and stability under Tropical Zone 4b standards. Methods of production compatible with low cost of goods production and scale will be prototyped. Dosage forms will be evaluated in extensive preclinical pharmacology studies in beagles, including stress conditions, and a toxicology study will be performed. This grant will deliver a product ready for IND-enabling studies and create capability for GMP production of clinical specimens for a phase 1 human pharmacokinetic (PK) study of ultra long-acting Lyndra-Ivermectin. ",Product development & clinical research,"Drug-based strategies, Tools for elimination"

However residual transmission due to outdoor and/ or early biting vectors is not tackled by wide coverage of insecticide treated nets (ITNs). This may compromise the elimination efforts. For this purpose this study aims to evaluate the public health value of mass use of topical repellent in addition to ITNs. A randomized community based design has been adopted covering a population of 40,000 inhabitants in the province of Ratanakiri in Cambodia. The 98 clusters were randomly divided in two arms after a pre-trial survey: one intervention arm (ITN and repellent) and one control arm (only ITNs). Comparing to a randomized household trial, present design has the advantage to avoid the risk of the repellent aversion effect and the exchange of products between the households. The principal indicator of effectiveness is the prevalence of parasite carriers measured by PCR techniques using a mobile molecular lab in the field, and the measurement of malaria antibodies. While parasite-prevalence provides a snapshot of the exposure to malaria at a certain moment, serological indicators provide a picture of the ?force of malaria infection? over a prolonged period. Moreover, passive case detection provides a measurement of malaria disease incidence in both arms.
The effectiveness of the intervention is dependent on the efficacy of the repellents against vector bites and the effective use of repellents by the population and both are addressed in the study design. The outcome of this study will be crucial in the development of new strategies to control not only the indoor transmission during sleeping time (ITN) but also the increasing proportion of residual transmission which occurs mainly outdoors, and before and after sleeping time.

Optimizing low-technology metofluthrin emanators to extend active ingredient release while maximizing protection against malaria transmission,http://www.malariaeradication.org/mesa-track/optimizing-low-technology-metofluthrin-emanators-extend-active-ingredient-release-while,Project,Jul-16,Dec-17,Kenya,$115 000,"Medical Research Council (MRC), UK",,Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI),Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM),Gerry F. Killeen,Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI),"Recently, a low-technology emanator was developed, consisting of commonly available Hessian sacking impregnated with the widely-used volatile pyrethroid transfluthrin, which is slowly released into the air in vapour phase. Emanators protected humans against behaviourally and physiologically resistant Anopheles arabiensis indoors and outdoors for over 2 years and killed the vast majority of mosquitoes that succeeded in feeding on protected humans. The disadvantage of transfluthrin is its relatively high melting point, which limits its vapour pressure and efficacy outside of low-altitude equatorial settings with very high night time temperatures. Fortunately, a similarly safe volatile pyrethroid called metofluthrin is also available from generic sources, which has a lower melting point so it remains volatile across the full range of temperatures relevant to malaria transmission.
If both objectives for this project are achieved, this early phase study will be followed by an application to conduct the main study: a community-randomized controlled trial to assess impact upon malaria incidence among both users and non-users, supplemented with participatory social science studies of end-user perceptions. Both studies will be conducted in a relatively high altitude (1100m) region of west Kenya with moderate temperatures.
","To test dose-optimization for an emanator prototype with metofluthrin, rather than transfluthrin, using a range of thicknesses of diffusion-retarding plastic coatings. 
The primary objective is to identify the minimum dose, and optimal coating thickness at that dose, which confers ?80% protection against exposure to biting An. arabiensis, as well as An. gambiae and An. funestus, for at least one year.
The secondary objective is to demonstrate that predicted maximum cost per year of protection is comparable with those for long-lasting insecticidal nets.

Human Decoy Trap; operational and social acceptability of novel tool to improve surveillance and control of mosquitoes and other disease vectors,http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/projects?ref=MR/P025404/1,Project,Feb-17,Jan-19,"Cameroon, Benin, Burkina Faso",$696 161,"Medical Research Council (MRC), UK","GBP 556,461",,"Natural Resources Institute (NRI), University of Greenwich",Gabriella Gibson,,"The malaria parasite is spread by infected mosquitoes and the most effective way to monitor the disease is to monitor populations of these mosquitoes. However, current tools for sampling malarial mosquitoes are time-consuming and labour intensive, making them expensive and difficult to standardize. To solve this problem, a mosquito trap that exploits the blood-seeking behaviour of mosquitoes by mimicking the sensory stimuli that a mosquito follows when searching for a person to bite has been developed. These include the look, smell and temperature of warm-blooded hosts. These stimuli have been incorporated into a trap that lures mosquitoes towards it and then captures them when they land.
Longer-term, a version of the Human Decoy Trap can be deployed as a mosquito control tool. The most effective way of controlling malaria is to reduce the number of infective mosquito bites a person receives. This is currently achieved by providing people with insecticide-treated bed nets to protect them from bites whilst they sleep and spraying the walls inside houses thus killing mosquitoes that rest there. However, neither of these options protects people from mosquitoes that may bite them outdoors during the day or just before they go to bed at night. Data from this current project will be used to provide preliminary evidence for the suitability of the Human Decoy Trap as a control tool that is specifically targeted at malaria mosquitoes biting outdoors, which may also be effective against other species of mosquitoes that can carry other infectious diseases, such as dengue fever, chikungunya and Zika viruses. A successful outdoor mosquito control device would help to reduce the population of infected mosquitoes that cause malaria. 
","To test the ""Human Decoy"" Trap against current methods used in mosquito monitoring to determine whether the Human Decoy Trap can overcome the limitations of existing tools.
To evaluate if Human Decoy Trap catches are suitably similar to those of current outdoor traps in terms of numbers of mosquitoes and other important data related to malaria that can be extracted from mosquitoes caught by traps, such as the proportion of caught mosquitoes infected with malaria parasites.

The floral dimension of African Malaria,https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8320883&icde=35301318,Project,Aug-09,Aug-15,United States,$2 231 847,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,Ohio State University,Woodbridge Foster,,"This project concerns a never-investigated dimension of the world?s most important insect. Until now, virtually nothing was known about the existence or significance of a plant-vector relationship in African malaria. It was assumed that plants played no significant role in adult Anopheles gambiae biology and therefore would be irrelevant to Plasmodium transmission. This team has now has credible evidence to the contrary, both from lab and field. For the first time, there is direct evidence of frequent An. gambiae plant-sugar feeding in the field. There are also experimental results on the timing of nectar feeding, host-plant preferences, volatile plant attractants, plant-inhibited Plasmodium development, severely reduced insemination ability of plant-deprived males, and reduced egg production and survival of females lacking plant sugars, but increased biting frequency. What?s more, the mosquito shares its plant hosts with a predator that specializes in killing Anopheles. These discoveries put an entirely new spin on An. gambiae ecology. Is the mosquito-plant connection important to malaria? Does it have practical applications for transmission suppression, or for genetic methods of control? Quite likely, so. All of these interconnected plant-focused topics need serious attention and are addressed in this proposal. The plant-dependency angle offers some special vulnerabilities of the Plasmodium-Anopheles relationship, each a potential Achilles' heel: a) inadequate insemination by males, b) reduced female survival and fecundity, and c) vector incompetence.
","To proceed with a novel plant-mosquito investigation. The first major step will be to determine, through outdoor screen house experiments in semi-natural conditions, how big is the effect of the mosquito's natural host plants on 2 key features of vector biology: 1) reproductive output and 2) vectorial capacity. Put as questions: In the field, will plant-host scarcity substantially compromise a male?s insemination ability and competitiveness and substantially decrease a female?s egg output? And in the field, will plant-host scarcity reduce female survival and, paradoxically, also reduce biting frequency, thereby significantly diminishing vectorial capacity? The answers have practical value, because selective manipulation of plant communities may depress pathogen transmission through both direct and indirect effects and may favour genetic methods of malaria control. Furthermore, innate and learned plant attractants, plant-derived Plasmodium inhibitors, and plant-attracted predators all may have practical value.
Gaining knowledge on plant attractants can be used to develop new vector control strategies such as outdoor traps.",Entomology,Elimination strategies
Chemical genetic screening to identify synergistic inhibitors of malaria parasite cell cycle regulators,https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=9227651&icde=35281972,Project,Dec-16,Nov-18,,$238 063,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health,Manoj T. Duraisingh,,"Infection of humans with Plasmodium falciparum parasites results in significant morbidity and mortality. In the face of drug-resistance, it is imperative to identify new antimalarial lead compounds to ensure the success of control and eradication efforts. Screening parasites in vitro against large numbers of small molecules has led to the identification of several antimalarials that are now at an advanced stage of development, with forward chemical genomic approaches being powerfully employed to identify putative molecular targets.
Conditional protein expression approaches allow the identification of essential genes in the asexual cycle of Plasmodium parasites in red blood cells. In particular, the PfCRK4 gene has been identified as an essential regulator of DNA replication during asexual schizogony.
In this project, a new approach to identify small molecule inhibitors of essential genes, using parasite lines with conditional knockdown in specific target proteins, is proposed. Small molecule inhibitor screens will be carried out to identify compounds that synergize with PfCRK4 knockdown to inhibit parasite growth. Drug screens with kinase inhibitor libraries will be performed, biased to directly target PfCRK4, and structurally diverse bioactive libraries. The hypothesis is that these screens will simultaneously reveal both specific inhibitors of the PfCRK4 enzyme, and secondary inhibitors that target molecules in pathways closely related to PfCRK4 that are synergistic with the PfCRK4-specific inhibitors. The specificity of the compounds will be further established by a combination of reverse chemical genetics and forward chemogenomic approaches. Of great value will be lead compounds against the essential putative drug target PfCRK4 that may inform drug development. The team believes that the chemical genetic platform described here will simultaneously identify direct as well as secondary inhibitors of target pathways, important for the design of optimal drug combinations that might impede the emergence of drug-resistance.
","The aim of this proposal is to establish a novel experimental strategy, combining chemical and genetic approaches, to identify lead compounds for malaria drug development.

Distinct sensory modalities often rely on related molecular receptors. In some cases, the same receptor participates in multiple sensory modalities. How does such polymodality emerge? How can it be regulated to enable sensory discrimination? The project team will probe these issues by studying two classes of polymodal receptors they have identified in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster whose polymodality is regulated by complementary molecular mechanisms.  
This proposal investigates the fundamental molecular mechanisms that regulate chemical and thermal sensation by examining the ability of sensory receptors to participate in multiple sensory modalities. The ability to sense and respond to chemicals (such as chemical repellents and moisture) and to temperature is critical for animal physiology, and the dysregulation of these sensory modalities can contribute to disease. In insects, the ability to sense temperature and humidity is important for host-seeking by insect vectors for widespread human diseases like malaria and dengue. Furthermore, the detection of chemical repellents is important for the action of vector control agents. Thus, the study of chemical and thermal sensation is of biomedical relevance.

To probe the molecular mechanisms by which the activity of a receptor for both moderate warming and aversive chemicals can be regulated in a cell-specific fashion to achieve appropriate sensitivity and specificity, and use these studies to investigate the molecular basis of thermal and chemical detection in both fruit flies and Anopheles mosquitoes.
To investigate how a pair of receptors act together to mediate both thermosensation and hygrosensation, and how these distinct activities are regulated to confer appropriate behavioral responses to each stimulus in both fruit flies and Anopheles mosquitoes.

Chan School of Public Health,Dyann Wirth,"Broad Institute, US","Drug resistance remains a pressing concern for antimalarial chemotherapies. Management of resistance has largely been a reactive process, but the approach presented in this project exploits predicted evolutionary trajectories to maintain a drug-sensitive parasite population. The strategy is to design new drugs such that the fitness cost of resistance restricts the ability of mutant parasites to survive combination therapy or to persist in the absence of selection. Through whole organism high-throughput screening many new chemotypes that act on mitochondrial targets have been discovered, and either in combination or in a single molecule they target both wild-type and mutant parasites and suppress the emergence of resistance in vitro.
This project focuses on the Plasmodium falciparum dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (PfDHODH) target and fully explores the structural, functional, and fitness consequences of drug resistance pathways. Findings are extended from our current award to fully explore mutually incompatible resistance, establishing an in vivo model system to understand the impact of the host environment on the parasite's ability to escape drug pressure. PfDHODH is clinically relevant and has multiple structural classes of inhibitors providing a substantial toolset with which to study the combination strategy in depth. Chemical inhibitors that target wild-type and mutant forms of DHODH will be identified and efficacy optimized for in vivo studies. Using an approach that has proven highly productive, the team will prioritize the molecules based on cross-resistance screening against a panel of resistant mutants and focus on compounds demonstrating validated potency against both the wild-type and mutants. Resistance mutations will be validated and the structural and biological consequences of these mutations assessed by determining the structures of the most prevalent mutant forms, measuring the effects of the mutations on the enzyme, on mitochondrial function, and on the growth of the organism. This has implications not just for this work, but also for others in the field who are developing methods to prevent the emergence of drug resistance.
","This project aims to:
use evolutionary biology principles to anticipate and then block the most fit resistance pathways in order to protect the efficacy of antimalarial therapies.
validate combinations of or single dual-active PfDHODH inhibitors that kill both the wild-type and resistant mutant-type parasites and assess the biochemical, structural, and fitness consequences of resistance mutations to these inhibitors.

Resistance to existing anti-malarial medications is an urgent problem and may prevent effective eradication strategies. A molecular understanding of the life cycle of P. falciparum will facilitate the rational design of new therapies. Efficient egress of P. falciparum out of an infected human red blood cell is a fundamental step in the parasite life cycle, and a step that is not targeted by current anti-malarial therapeutics. PfCDPK5 has recently been identified as a kinase that is critical for parasite egress. Using a state-of-the-art inducible protein destabilization system, functional evaluation of this essential gene is now possible. Transgenic parasites with an inducible knockdown in PfCDPK5 are arrested prior to egress. The ability to regulate the level of PfCDPK5 provides a unique resource to study both the mechanism of activation and the downstream effectors of this essential kinase. 
","The hypothesis is that PfCDPK5 is a central mediator of the calcium-based egress signaling pathway.
The immediate goals of this proposal are to gain a molecular understanding of PfCDPK5 activation and characterize its role in the egress signaling pathway. In the first aim, a molecular genetic analysis of PfCDPK5 activation will be conducted using transgenic parasites that allow inducible regulation of essential protein levels. In the second aim, the downstream substrate(s) of PfCDPK5 will be discovered using both a candidate gene approach as well as advanced proteomic techniques.

Chan School of Public Health,"Our ability to effectively treat malaria is threatened by increasingly widespread resistance to the limited number of frontline antimalarial drugs available. Consequently, new strategies guiding prioritization of novel targets for drug development are critically needed.  Defining essential mitochondrial proteins and biological processes should provide new insights into fundamental parasite biology. Additionally, this can create opportunities for developing antimalarial drugs that simultaneously target blood, transmission, and liver stages of the parasite life cycle. Drugs with these characteristics are critical to malaria elimination efforts. To accomplish the objectives of this proposal, two aims will be pursued by the team. In Specific Aim 1, they will use bioinformatics tools to predict mitochondrial targeting sequences (MTS) in nuclear-encoded proteins, and create prioritized lists of putative mitochondrial proteins. They will create libraries of MTS candidates fused to a fluorescent reporter protein and use high throughput and high content imaging to determine whether a candidate MTS is sufficient to mediate protein trafficking to the mitochondrion. In Specific Aim 2, they will use a newly developed functional genetics toolkit to epitope tag and conditionally regulate the expression level of endogenous proteins putatively trafficked to the mitochondrion. This will prove whether native proteins associated with a given MTS are indeed trafficked to the mitochondrion. Conditionally regulating the expression of these proteins will additionally facilitate assessment of which mitochondrial proteins are essential for parasite survival. This approach is innovative because it integrates several complementary technologies-combinatorial reporter library synthesis and parasite line generation, high content imaging and functional genetics-to gain insight into mitochondrial biology on an unprecedented scale in P. falciparum. The proposed research is significant because it will provide definitive insights into the composition and vital components of this relatively enigmatic parasite organelle. Simultaneously, it will motivate targeted interference with mitochondrial function as a strategy for identifying life cycle stage-independent antimalarial drugs. These outcomes are expected to positively impact human health by improving the tools available for malaria treatment and eradication.
","This project proposes targeting mitochondrial function as a strategy that could yield diverse solutions for treating malaria. The long-term goal is to define the mitochondrial proteome of the human malaria parasite, P. falciparum, and establish the core subset of these proteins that are essential for parasite survival.

Drug-resistance is constantly undermining the usefulness of antimalarial regimens. There is an urgent need for the development of new therapeutic strategies. Plasmodium falciparum parasites utilize multiple ligand-receptor interactions for the invasion of human erythrocytes. Much work has focused on the characterization of parasite ligands, with the goal of developing them as vaccine candidates. Largely due to the genetic intractabiliy of enucleated human erythrocytes, the function of host human erythrocyte receptors in ligand-receptor interactions has not been comprehensively assessed. The team has developed an approach combining an in vitro erythrocyte culture system, which supports P. falciparum invasion and growth, with lentiviral transduction to generate genetically modified erythrocytes. The best characterized ligand-receptor interaction in P. falciparum is that of the ligand EBA-175 and its receptor glycophorin A, with EBA-175 being developed as a vaccine candidate. Using this system, they have achieved knockdown in expression of glycophorin A, genetically demonstrating that it is required for efficient strain-specific parasite invasion. The hypothesis is that targeting a limited number of erythrocyte receptors will be sufficient to abrogate P. falciparum invasion in all P. falciparum parasite lines. This project will functionally analyze erythrocyte determinants of the invasion process of P. falciparum. They will use 1) a loss-of- function approach to establish a hierarchy amongst putative erythrocyte receptors for invasion, 2) a combinatorial knockdown approach to identify minimal sets of erythrocyte surface determinants that are essential for invasion and 3) a genetic screen to identify human blood group antigens that are novel determinants of invasion.

A forward-genetic system to investigate the function of essential genes does not exist currently. The main goal is to establish a much needed forward-genetic system in P. falciparum. The forward-genetic analysis relies upon a robust and tightly controlled inducible expression system that will be used to perform saturating transposon-mediated mutagenesis in P. falciparum. The team will apply next- generation sequencing to parasites following saturating mutagenesis to identify essential genes. In addition, they will follow mutated parasites for several generations using deep sequencing to assign a relative fitness effect to disruption of the remaining non-essential genes. The immediate goals of this proposal are to generate a list of essential genes in P. falciparum. This list, together with a preliminary molecular characterization of gene function, will be an important resource for the malaria research community. The long-term objectives and public health implications of these studies are to identify novel targets for new anti- malarial therapeutics.

Chan School of Public Health, Broad Institute, US","Since 2000, renewed international commitment to malaria control has led to a substantial increase in malaria intervention coverage globally. However, there are disturbing signs that this trend has slowed, stalled or even reversed in some regions due to failures in vector control. Even if all households had insecticidal bed nets, emerging insecticide resistance, behavioral changes and outdoor transmission by vectors raise concerns that existing tools are inadequate to eliminate or even interrupt intense malaria transmission. Near-term strategies to manage resistance have been outlined, but longer-term research into new anti-vector interventions to complement existing tools is imperative. Many basic aspects of anopheline biology that could contribute to more effective control remain poorly defined. Anopheles funestus is one of the three most important and widespread vectors of human malaria in tropical Africa, but unlike An. gambiae, it is understudied. This major vector conceals a group of close relatives that are morphologically similar or identical as adults. None of these species, with one exception, has been directly implicated as a secondary vector. However, they can rest indoors in large numbers and are considered important due to their impact on scarce resources available for vector control. They overlap with An. funestus, but their geographic distribution is largely unknown, and their actual or potential contribution to malaria transmission is also uncertain. Traditionally characterized as zoophilic and exophilic, their behavior is plastic and depends upon host availability and other (unknown) environmental factors. Moreover, the taxonomic complexity of this group is at least as high as the better- known An. gambiae complex; within each named (or unnamed) species are genetically heterogeneous clusters whose interrelationships have never been resolved, and additional cryptic diversity is being reported by vector control programs. 
","The central goal of this project is to elucidate the An. funestus complex.
Toward this end, two Specific Aims are proposed:
Generate reference genome assemblies for species in the An. funestus complex. Complete reference genome assemblies have the power necessary to elucidate taxonomic and phylogenetic relationships among closely related taxa. Traditional approaches to genome assembly are impractical, but our preliminary data establish that the DISCOVAR de novo algorithm represents a simple, rapid and low-cost solution.
Assess sequence divergence and speciation history in the An. funestus complex. Using the new reference assemblies and additional light whole genome sequencing (~12 samples/taxon), we will analyze genome-wide SNP data to construct an initial portrait of population genomic patterns and species relationships for five members of the An. funestus complex. This project will provide the necessary frame of reference for species delimitation, identification, and vector incrimination in the An. funestus complex to support sustainable control or elimination of malaria transmission in Africa.

Chan School of Public Health,Caroline Buckee,Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) ,"Although elimination is likely to be technically feasible throughout much of these regions, existing strategic plans, funding, and operations are tailored more towards burden reduction than achieving elimination. Eliminating malaria in these regions in a sustainable, cost-effective way will require an understanding of how to achieve the greatest possible impact with limited financial resources, while going beyond the paradigm of independent planning and implementation in each country. Reaching the required level of programmatic capacity will require substantial technical, operational, and financial support to strengthen surveillance systems, devise targeted, evidence-based plans, identify sufficient resources to enact them, scale-up parasite-focused and vector control interventions in high risk and hard-to-reach populations, and coordinate activities regionally. To support all countries to adopt coordinated, evidence-based plans, secure adequate capacity and resources to scale up elimination-tailored strategies, and execute programs that will dramatically accelerate progress towards elimination, CHAI proposes to rapidly scale up direct technical, operational, and financial support to a regional group of national malaria programs within Southern Africa and the GMS. CHAI's core model is to place staff to work directly with Ministries of Health to improve operational and logistical functioning and ensure that national programs have the capacity and systems in place to achieve their goals. Technically, CHAI will support governments to improve the analysis of surveillance and mobility data, enabling micro planning, spatial and temporal targeting of interventions, and derivation of data-driven strategies for elimination. Operationally, CHAI will support governments to achieve high confirmatory diagnosis rates, improve adherence to test results, strengthen surveillance systems and build national elimination organizations, identify programmatic gaps and define solutions to them, and plan the execution and scale up of evidence-based strategies to achieve elimination. Financially, CHAI will help cost elimination requirements, reorient existing funding towards optimized, evidence-based strategies, and work to mobilize additional resource requirements for achieving and sustaining elimination. Providing this support to regional groups of countries that share a common malaria catchment, with interwoven epidemiological drivers and closely related populations, is critical given the dependencies of each country's success upon its neighbors. Achieving successful elimination in lower endemic countries like Swaziland will only be feasible if substantial progress is made in their high endemic neighbors like Mozambique.
The primary outcome of this investment will be to support at least three countries in southern Africa and two countries in the GMS to have eliminated indigenous cases of Plasmodium falciparum and all others within the target regions to make reductions in their parasite reservoirs by catalyzing elimination planning, financing, surveillance, and targeted response activities. This outcome is ambitious and is contingent upon certain externalities that are not entirely within CHAI's control. Nevertheless, CHAI believes aiming for any outcome short of successful elimination will be insufficient. In the GMS, outcomes less than regional elimination mean accepting that artemisinin-resistant parasites will soon make their way to Africa where they may set back a decade of progress. In southern Africa, they require telling countries that there is no global appetite for ambitious targets beyond scaling up control measures, and that we must do the best we can for as long as we can until resistance, fatigue, and funding gaps eventually overcome programs. Although the primary outcome focuses on the ultimate achievement of elimination in only a few countries, getting there requires simultaneous investment and transformative changes in all countries that share the same malaria problem: again, Swaziland cannot sustainably eliminate until Mozambique achieves substantial reductions in the parasite reservoir in the southern provinces that border it. CHAI thus proposes to embed staff to provide simultaneous support to all countries within the chosen catchment areas to ensure they are working in concert to scale up evidence-based strategies, optimize the use of limited resources, and target interventions to where they will be most impactful. The supporting outputs to achieving elimination in a few places and draining the parasite reservoir everywhere else thus involve substantial technical, operational, and financial gains throughout the entire interconnected region. CHAI believes that this initial investment of a few dedicated support staff will catalyze progress, achieve elimination in some settings, make substantial progress in others, and generate evidence for where increased future investment will achieve it elsewhere. Eliminating malaria will support the Foundation's strategic goals of accelerating elimination in southern Africa, including achieving it by 2020 in Zambia, Namibia, Botswana, Swaziland, and South Africa, and sub-nationally in southern Mozambique, and in the GMS, with elimination of P. falciparum targeted in Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, and elimination of P. falciparum from all zone 1 and 2 artemisinin resistance areas targeted for Myanmar and Thailand by 2020.
Progress towards this primary outcome will ultimately be measured according to, first, the number of countries that document zero indigenous cases for at least one year, and second, the number of countries that record meaningful reductions in their annual positivity rates. Supporting outcomes necessary to achieve these goals will include better planning, resource usage, and operational execution in all countries within the target regions. To successfully achieve the project's goal, CHAI will focus its efforts on achieving three core intermediary outcomes that correspond to technical, financial, and operational improvement in program functioning:
1.1 All countries adopt evidence-based and sustainable strategies and costed operational plans (including the what, where, when, and why) 1.2 All countries have increased and/or more effectively allocated resources for executing malaria elimination programs1.3 All countries have improved malaria program operations in accordance with their revised elimination strategies and plans
",The aim of the proposed investment is to accelerate the operational reorientation of national malaria programs in Southern Africa and the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) from control to elimination. ,,

These interventions require that patients who have variable disease states be carefully stratified into an exact subgroup in order to provide therapies that impact specific mortality. New interventions may come from an in depth understanding of the in vivo physiology (define by genetics and expression profiling) of the parasite which is not only unique in these children but also not reproducible in vitro. This field study has pioneered the use of eye exams to identify malaria retinopathy in the setting of patients with clinical cerebral malaria - these findings cleanly separate patients into ""true"" cerebral malaria (retinopathy positive) and coma of other causes (retinopathy negative). Moreover, the team's database and tissue repository of over 100 pediatric autopsies from a prospective clinicopathological correlation study of cerebral malaria is the most comprehensive one available. The biology of Plasmodium falciparum in vivo in cerebral malaria includes the expression of the virulent var genes as well as a set of 800 genes which are never expressed in vitro. Using an archive and prospective collection from a stringently defined cohort of comatose patients including both cerebral malaria patients and parasitemic patients with other causes of coma, the team will have the opportunity to thoroughly characterize the in vivo biology of both var and unique in vivo genes of Plasmodium falciparum and understand their control and function within human disease using a comprehensive systems biology approach. Full genome sequencing of parasites from patients (including clinical cases and autopsy tissues) who meet the above definitions and have low complexity infections based on our molecular genotyping tools will be performed. This full genome information will then be combined with expression data from the same parasites using the novel Nanostring approach (which allows for full imputation of gene expression by measuring only 330 marker genes from minute samples of RNA) with confirmation by RNA expression and digital gene expression. The integration of these two robust data sets will allow the definition of expression quantitative trait loci within the genome both directing the overall in vivo biology and specifically elucidating control and function within the unique genes found only during human infection. At the conclusion of this study, the team will have defined the network of unique in vivo expressed genes during human infection, characterized the specific expression of var genes within individual patients, and identified which of these are putative targets for intervention strategies.

Developing innovative approaches and establishing novel applications of established approaches requires multi-disciplinary research. The research should be carried out in sites which span the ecological spectrum in which malaria thrives. Close coordination with policy makers enhances the transition from ""data"" to policy. Malawi, a landlocked country in southern Africa, is the ideal setting for transformative malaria research. Malawi contains within its boundaries nearly all of the ecogeographic settings relevant to malaria control. Malaria research in Malawi has been ongoing for over 20 years, and is concentrated in its one medical school, the University of Malawi College of Medicine. The National Malaria Control Programme, the relevant policy-making body in Malawi, has made a series of data driven decisions, and its link with investigators in the College of Medicine is strong. The Malawi ICEMR will harness all of these advantages to establish a self-sustaining research entity capable of developing the scientific basis for designing, implementing, and evaluating malaria control and prevention strategies. Core activities (Administrative, Data Management and Biostatistics, and Molecular and Genomic) will be based in the College of Medicine, and research activities will take place in 3 epidemiologically diverse sites, all located within 50 kilometers of each other.
By identifying the contributions made by the parasite, the human host and the mosquito vector to the incidence and prevalence of malaria disease in diverse eco-geographic settings in Malawi, we will be able to tailor prevention and control strategies to specific seasons (dry, rainy) and locales (highland and lowland, urban and rural), and determine the critical parameters required for monitoring impact.

Chan School of Public Health,Danny A. Milner,,"Malaria remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide and affects about half the global population, despite decades of public health efforts. The recent commitment to eliminate malaria by many endemic countries marks a shift in public health policy away from programs aimed at controlling disease burden towards one that emphasizes reducing transmission of the most virulent human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum. Only a very small fraction of malaria parasites within human blood are able to infect mosquitoes, however, these transmission stages have remained under-studied because they do not cause disease and are difficult to detect by conventional methods. Because malaria transmission stages are rarely detected, it has been assumed that only a small fraction of malaria-infected individuals are capable of infecting mosquitoes. Recent preliminary data suggest that this dogma is wrong, and that people with low-density malaria infections can, in fact, transmit to mosquitoes very efficiently. In addition, it has been demonstrated that blood meals directly from the skin of an infected participant more commonly result in mosquito infection compared to blood meals from venous blood samples. This led to the hypothesis that transmissible malaria parasite stages cluster under the skin where mosquitoes can find them most effectively. If this hypothesis is correct, all previous analyses of infectiousness based on venous blood are not accurate. The clustering of transmission stages under the skin may contribute considerably to the phenomenally efficient spread of malaria parasites in populations. In this project, the aim is to test this hypothesis directly using a unique set of autopsies from fatal malaria cases in Malawi and using mosquito-feeding experiments in Burkina Faso. Human samples will be analysed using both histology and a new Nanostring platform, a highly sensitive expression tailored for P. falciparum asexual and transmission stages. In parallel mosquito feeding outcome from the different human compartments sampled (skin and venous blood) will be determined. Together, this interdisciplinary study will test long-standing and powerful hypothesis using modern tools. As such it will lay the foundation for accurate predictions of malaria transmissibility at a population level that can inform public health interventions and timelines to achieve malaria elimination. If gametocytes are observed to cluster under the skin, this study will form the starting point for systematic mechanistic studies and may lead to novel transmission- blocking interventions.
Eliminating malaria will require a shift towards control policies that reduce transmission of the malaria parasite in addition to controlling disease, but progress in the design of these policies is currently limited by our poor understanding of human infectiousness. Here a series of molecular and histological tools will be combined with experimental feeding assays to measure infectiousness parameters in human and mosquito. Together, these studies will address one of the most urgent problems in malaria epidemiology: how to define the human infectious reservoir.
","The goal of this research project is to define the human malaria infectious reservoir. A combination of autopsy tissue, as well as experimental mosquito-feeding assays, will be used to determine the contribution of each organ in gametocyte burden and transmissibility. ",,
Cytoadherence and sequestration of malaria transmission stages,https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8499202&icde=32098388,Project,Jul-10,Dec-15,"United States, Malawi",$1 598 459,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health,Matthias Marti,,"Cytoadherence and the resulting sequestration of infected red blood cells are a hallmark of P. falciparum malaria. Previous studies have emphasized the major contribution of the knob complex and particularly the major parasite antigen, PfEMP1, in mediating cytoadherence during the last 20 hours of asexual development of P. falciparum parasites. Mature sexual stages of P. falciparum only appear in the peripheral blood after 8-10 days of development, and sequestration of immature sexual stages in anatomical niches must be absolutely crucial for successful transmission of these parasites to the mosquito vector. Where is that anatomical niche, and what is the molecular basis for cytoadherence in sexual stages? 
Sexual P. falciparum stages are a major target for both drug- and vaccine-based strategies to block transmission of the parasite in endemic areas. In the context of widespread resistance against the currently used drug formulations that almost exclusively target asexual development within the red blood cell, transmission-blocking strategies have gained renewed interest and are now a major focus of worldwide efforts to reduce the burden of malaria. The proposed experiments are in line with these efforts as they aim to elucidate a mechanism crucial for the survival and development of malaria transmission stages in the human host.
Strategies aiming at blocking the transmission of malaria parasites play a central role in the current efforts to eradicate malaria worldwide. It is, therefore, crucial to understand the key properties of transmission stages in the human host and the mosquito vector. One of these properties is the sequestration of developing sexual stages in deep tissues, before they eventually emerge in the blood circulation as mosquito-infective mature gametocytes. A comprehensive analysis of the mechanisms of cytoadherence and sites of sequestration of developing transmission stages in the human host is proposed in this project.
","The experimental approaches outlined in this project aim to distinguish the three possible mechanisms by which developing sexual stages induce cytoadherence, and to identify the corresponding sequestration profiles in patient tissues: 
Developing sexual stages cytoadhere through the same determinants as asexual stages, i.e., the same PfEMP1 is expressed on the infected red blood cell surface. This would result in largely overlapping sequestration profiles for asexual and sexual stages.
They cytoadhere through the same mechanisms asexual stages, but using a different determinant, i.e., a PfEMP1 specific to sexual development. This situation would likely result in gametocyte-specific site of sequestration, similar to placental sequestration of parasites expressing a conserved PfEMP1 variant.
They cytoadhere through a different mechanism altogether, i.e., a molecule (or class of molecules) other than PfEMP1. In this case, the sequestration profile would also be different from that of asexual stages.

They have learned that the traditional clinical case definition is often incorrect. Autopsies revealed that 25% of the children who were assumed to have cerebral malaria actually died for other reasons. Despite obvious neuropathology in the brains of children dying of cerebral malaria, we cannot yet conclude that the deaths are actually due to central nervous system damage. The overall goals of this project are to understand what kills children who die of cerebral malaria and to determine if the relevant pathogenic mechanisms can be identified in life. With this knowledge, new interventions, capable of reducing the mortality rate of cerebral malaria (1-2 million African children each year) can be developed. It is now recognized that we have reached the limit of autopsy-based studies: the data are generated from a single point in time (the time of death) and thus cannot reveal processes, and tissues are only available from those who die, precluding comparisons with survivors. In order to overcome these shortcomings, the incorporation of two new approaches that have not been applied systematically to cerebral malaria are proposedte: magnetic resonance imaging and neurophysiologic assessments of the brain. With this combination of in vivo and post mortem data, we will move beyond descriptive pathology to an improved understanding of relevant pathogenic mechanisms.

Chan School of Public Health,Caroline Buckee,University of Colorado Boulder,"Many of the most important human pathogens including the malaria parasite, HIV, and the pneumococcus, are characterized by extensive genetic diversity generated by recombination. In order to design of effective vaccines and long-lasting drug regimens, it is critical that we understand how this diversity relates to the epidemiological dynamics of disease in human populations. While high throughput sequencing techniques are generating vast volumes of genomic sequence data from these pathogens, the analytical tools capable of making sense of them are severely limited. One of the most pressing problems is the lack of tools that can deal with these pathogens? high rates of recombination, particularly when considering the vast genetic datasets now being generated by high throughput sequencing techniques. This project represents an interdisciplinary collaboration between computer scientists and malaria biologists, bringing together deep expertise on network analysis, computational methods, epidemiology, evolutionary biology and malaria, to develop a new suite of scalable, general computational tools for visualizing and analyzing recombinant gene sequences, using the malaria parasite as a case study.
","Drawing on recent advances in the field of network science, the project will develop novel methods for accurately inferring ?recombination networks? from sequence data, automatically identifying statistically significant ?clusters? in these networks, and testing their epidemiological significance. Our approach focuses on alignment-free analysis methods, which naturally accommodate the recombinant shuffling of sequences, allows for the analysis of structural features of the relationships between genes, and provides insights into the effects of recombination on their evolution. In additional to answering important biological and epidemiological questions, this project will produce a novel open-source software platform that will enable researchers to analyze recombinant sequence data from a wide variety of important human pathogens.",Basic science,Parasite genetic diversity

In Ulanga district, south-eastern Tanzania, malaria has declined by 60% since 2001 but low-level transmission persists despite 80% bednet coverage. Many families practice migratory rice farming, spending weeks or months in their farms, 5-35km away. They live in semi-open improvised huts (Shamba-houses), far from organized health services and without effective protection. Initially, data available at Ifakara Health Institute and key informant interviews will be used to categorize migratory lifestyles, based on time people spend in their fields. Then, pre and post farming season screenings of consenting adult migratory farmers will be conducted, and their age-matched non-migratory controls, and all Plasmodium-infected participants will be treated. During the farming season, malaria vectors indoors and outdoors will be collected in farms and main villages, to analyse where and when these farmers experience most infectious bites. The findings will guide targeted interventions for these migratory sub-populations.

Moore,,"Many interventions against mosquito vectors of disease are currently under development. These include new insecticidal compounds applied in established interventions like indoor residual spraying (IRS) and insecticide treated mosquito nets (ITNs). Also under development are novel or un-established interventions such as spatial repellents (SR) and odour-baited mosquito traps (OBT). Each of these interventions have effects over larger areas than the immediate vicinity to which they are applied, because mosquitoes move between aquatic breeding sites and vertebrate hosts to complete their life cycle. As a consequence, impacts on mosquito populations under natural conditions can be far greater than estimated from standard tests carried out at small-scale. These community/area/ or mass effects driven by mosquito movement mean that large-scale field-testing of vector control interventions raises both statistical and operational issues that have a spatial dimension, different from those of clinical trials of health interventions that only protect directly treated individuals, such as chemotherapy or chemoprophylaxis. To accelerate product development, registration and implementation and make interventions more cost efficient, it is especially important to understand how a mosquito control intervention with specific performance criteria, as measured in small-scale experiments (such as mortality or repellency) will perform in the real world. This can be achieved by modelling relationships between small-scale and real-world performance indicators, to enable effects on transmission and public health outcomes to be extrapolated from small high-throughput experiments without the need to repeat larger scale field trials. However, uncertainties in our understanding of mosquito dispersal limit the potential of predictive modelling of vector control interventions and little is known about whether/how best to target such interventions in real-world environments that are heterogeneous in the spatial distributions of mosquito breeding-sites, of humans and other hosts, and of existing interventions.

The success of these strategies lies in their exploitation of a key vulnerability of the Anopheles mosquitoes that transmit malaria: their strong behavioural predisposition to feed at night when people are sleeping and rest inside their houses. LLINs and IRS continue to prove highly successful for targeting mosquitoes that feed and rest indoors, but are less effective against mosquitoes with more flexible feeding and resting behaviour. Consequently, with the expansion of LLIN and IRS programs, there has been a substantial ecological shift in the composition of mosquito vectors from endophilic species such as An. gambiae s.s., towards those such as An. arabiensis that have more variable feeding and resting behaviours. An. arabiensis can avoid contact with insecticides by feeding on other animal species, biting and resting outdoors and/or earlier in the evening.  In recent years, in the Kilombero Valley of Tanzania, the proportion of malaria transmission due to An. arabiensis has increased significantly and it now dominates transmission. There is growing evidence that An. arabiensis are capable of modifying their behaviour in the presence of vector control measures.
Working in four villages within the Kilombero Valley of Tanzania, namely Lupiro, Kidugalo, Minepa and Sagamaganga where malaria transmission is now dominated by An. arabiensis, we conducted detailed entomological investigations. Longitudinal surveillance of mosquito vector behaviours was established over a 5 year period (2011-2016) during which LLIN coverage levels were expected to grow to near 100% to test for the emergence of behavioural shifts in the timing and location of mosquito feeding and resting that may reduce the effectiveness of vector control.  
","In view of the potentially devastating epidemiological consequences of the development of behavioural avoidance strategies within mosquito vector populations, we conduct an in-depth investigation of the potential for this phenomenon to arise within the major malaria vector An. arabiensis in Tanzania, and evaluate its potential impact on the long-term sustainability of vector control measures.
In parallel, detailed ecological monitoring is conducted to identify the contribution of environmental factors to variation to these mosquito behaviours (e.g. inside versus outside, early or late evening biting), and evaluate their implications for human exposure risk in different settings.

These observations, though widely accepted have not been previously developed into practical actionable methodologies for disease prevention and control. Yet this close association between human aggregations and mosquito biting risk may significant influence on malaria parasite prevalence and infectiousness.

While the link between El Niño and disease is well established, the mechanism underlying it is not fully understood, but probably involves impact of the change in rainfall patterns (often drought and then heavy rain, or vice versa) or altered temperatures brought by El Niño on the vectors themselves. Here we aim to take advantage of the collection over the past 9 years of detailed entomological data on one VBD to detect a perturbation to vector dynamics caused by the current El Niño event. The strength of the current El Niño, the existence of high quality entomological data, the inclusion of the team responsible in this proposal, and access to local meteorological data provide a unique opportunity to understand how El Niño events trigger the emergence of VBDs. We focus on malaria, which remains the VBD with the greatest impact on human mortality and morbidity, and propose new fieldwork in the Kilombero valley area of central Tanzania, where there is a 30% prevalence of infection in people. The spatial limits of malaria distribution, its seasonal activity and the mosquito vector dynamics are very sensitive to climate factors, as well as the local capacity to control the disease. New and standard technologies will be used to measure mosquito vector properties within the Kilombero Valley. We will undertake 12 months of detailed entomological study in a number of previously-studied villages in the region, in the expectation of detecting a change or perturbation to vector dynamics or behaviour caused by El Niño. These new data will be analysed in the context of the 9 years of historic data already collected between 2006-2015 (this field campaign ended in May 2015), as well as malaria clinical data and different climate datasets, ranging from regional scale satellite estimates to local scale meteorological station data available for the studied region. Detailed weather data for the areas are available from a local weather station, and will be supported by temperature/humidity data collection in the study villages. Based on the findings, we will develop a better understanding of how El Niño impacts on malaria and its vectors (with applicability to a wider range of VBDs) and build a prototype early warning system for malaria risk in Tanzania. This will be a useful resource for local decision makers and public health specialists to target and allow vector control resources in future.

However, for the elimination of this disease, complementary vector control tools are continuously needed to speed up this process. We believe that mosquitoes themselves could be used to pick up small doses of insecticides and transfer these to their own breeding habitats, and this way, we can stop further proliferation of mosquito populations. This process is called Auto-dissemination. The candidate insecticide is Pyriproxyfen (PPF), a juvenile hormone analogue that inhibits normal growth in mosquito life stages, but also sterilizes adult mosquitoes. If delivered effectively to the malaria vectors breeding habitats, most mature juvenile mosquito stages will not become adults, and thus the density of mosquitoes will be reduced, consequently reducing malaria transmission. Our model mosquito is Anopheles arabiensis, a common vector in many residual malaria transmission settings in Africa.

New complementary approaches to control must be explored.
The development by Okumu and others of a blend of synthetic chemical attractants which was capable of attracting more Anopheles gambiae s.s. than a human, provided the key breakthrough towards the creation of a mass trapping system which could be used for malaria control. By luring Anopheles mosquitoes to traps in numbers that are high enough to suppress population size and reduce biting intensity, a decline in malaria transmission could be realized.
The SolarMal project aims to demonstrate proof of principle for the elimination of malaria from Rusinga Island, Western Kenya, using the nationwide adopted strategy of LLINs and case management, augmented by mass trapping of mosquito vectors. The use of novel technology and scientific development underpins all areas of the project; from the optimisation of chemical baits to attract mosquitoes, to the design of a new mosquito trap and the installation of solar panel systems to provide power to run the traps. Electronic tablets are used to record health and demographic surveillance data. The mosquito traps operate according to a counterflow mechanism previously shown to be highly effective in collecting anopheline mosquitoes and are designed to collect mosquitoes outdoors prior to house entry. Odour baits placed within the traps mimic human odourants.
In a unique variation on the stepped wedge intervention strategy, which we refer to as the hierarchical design, intervention implementation begins at one randomly selected household and expands radially until a cluster of houses with the intervention is created. The intervention implementation then commences in a second geographically distinct location, then a third, fourth, fifth etc., continuing until the whole island is covered. Outcome measures of malaria parasite prevalence and incidence, as well as estimates of malaria transmission intensity, will be used to assess the impact of the intervention. We expect the results to demonstrate that the use of odour baited traps is an effective, novel means of integrated malaria control.

Investing in new insecticides to combat malaria: Accelerating uptake of new tools to prevent and manage insecticide resistance,https://www.unitaid.eu/project/new-insecticides-combat-malaria/,Project,2016,2019,,$65 105 000,UNITAID ,,,IVCC,,,"Indoor residual spraying (IRS) ? spraying the walls and eaves of dwellings with insecticides ? is a tried and tested way of killing malarial mosquitoes, and controlling the disease. However, over time mosquitoes become resistant to the insecticides that they come into contact with most often. If unchecked, insecticide resistance could threaten gains against malaria. IRS coverage has fallen by around 40 percent over the last few years due to resistance of mosquitoes to older products and to the higher cost of new alternatives.
Only one next-generation IRS product is currently on the market. A key objective is to lower the price of the existing product and make it more widely available. A further aim is to get other new insecticidal products on market, to support resistance management.
Over four years, the project aims to protect as many as 50 million people from malaria in 16 African countries.
Progress so far: In 2016, IVCC and partners successfully completed an annual spraying season in four countries using the new insecticide. New countries have been identified for spraying during 2017, increasing the number of spraying programs from four to twelve.
The overall impact of the grant is to create a more sustainable market for next-generation IRS products. This should contribute to bringing back IRS to historical coverage levels, and mitigating resistance to key insecticides. Over the long term, this will help to prevent more malaria cases, thereby saving lives and averting treatment costs.

Beier,,"This project focuses on the outdoor resting and sugar-feeding behaviours of Anopheles malaria vector populations in Mali, West Africa, where, as in most African countries, malaria is a serious public health problem.
An understanding of mosquito behaviours in the outdoor environment is becoming increasingly important because there is a growing awareness that vector control tools beyond those used exclusively inside houses are needed to achieve successful malaria control and local elimination. Currently, for the major malaria vector species in Africa, Anopheles gambiae, An. arabiensis, and An. funestus, there is only limited knowledge on their outdoor resting behaviour, and the role of sugar or nectars in their life history is mostly speculated due to a lack of field-based evidence. Furthermore, resting and sugar feeding behaviours likely exhibit extensive phenotypic plasticity but the role of the ecological environment as the possible key driver has not been investigated.
Innovative aspects include: First, new field-based approaches will be used to investigate two important but highly neglected mosquito behaviours. Second, this is the first study to examine how mosquitoes adapt their outdoor-resting and sugar-feeding behaviours in response to seasonal changes in their local environment. Third, this project will explain how outdoor-resting and sugar-feeding behaviours impact vector survival and malaria parasite transmission dynamics. Fourth, new predictive models for identifying concentrations of malaria vectors will be rigorously field-tested and refined to improve their accuracy and potential utility beyond Mali. By providing a strong scientific basis for development of new approaches and tools for anopheline mosquito vector control in outdoor environments, this project has strong potential for helping Mali and other countries improve malaria control and advance toward the ultimate goal of elimination.
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project focuses on the outdoor resting and sugar-feeding behaviours of vector species of Anopheles mosquitoes at malaria endemic sites in Mali, West Africa. It addresses the need to better understand how adult mosquitoes adapt to seasonally changing environmental conditions, how limitations in critical environmental resources including vegetated habitats and flowering plants impact malaria transmission, and the challenge of developing new geographical approaches and tools to locate outdoor concentrations of adult mosquitoes. This research will contribute to more effective outdoor vector control to reduce malaria transmission in Africa.
","The goal of this project is to investigate Anopheles mosquito outdoor resting and sugar- feeding behaviours at ecologically diverse sites in Mali to determine how complex relationships between these behaviours and the seasonally changing local environment affect malaria transmission. Gaining knowledge about feeding behaviours can help in the development of new vector control tools such as outdoor traps and baits.
This project, which builds on extensive preliminary studies in Mali and Israel, includes three specific aims:
Characterize how malaria vector species select from different types, configurations, and qualities of potential outdoor resting microhabitats and sugar-feeding centers, and behaviourally adapt to seasonal changes in their local environment,
Determine how local environmental resources critical for malaria vector outdoor resting and sugar feeding affect malaria vectorial capacity and spatial aggregation patterns of malaria parasite transmission and

The role of insect sweet taste receptors in detecting sweet and bitter compounds ,https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8684997&icde=34891817&ddparam=&ddvalue=&ddsub=&cr=1&csb=default&cs=ASC&pball,Project,Jul-13,Jun-15,United States,$762 012,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,"University of California, Riverside",Erica Freeman,,"All insects, including mosquitoes, must be able to determine the palatability of potential food sources. This makes the use of sugar-baited traps an effective method to control the spread of mosquito borne illnesses.
D. melanogaster is a model organism to study gustation because the fly can detect a broad range of compounds but has a relatively simple neurophysiology. Gustatory receptors (Gr) are expressed in taste neurons and members of this family are implicated in the detection of sweet or bitter tastants by genetic analyses. However, there has been little success in expressing these receptors in heterologous expression systems, which has led to a critical gap in understanding the functional properties of individual insect Grs, as well as in identifying the composition of a functional insect taste receptor. This represents an important problem because Grs belong to a family that is highly conserved in insects and non-insect arthropods.
To address this problem, we will use two parallel approaches to study sweet taste receptors in Drosophila and mosquitoes, taking advantage of a novel in vivo expression system that we have designed for decoding Drosophila gustatory receptor proteins. Using this approach, I have identified sugar response profiles of each of the putative sweet taste receptors in D. melanogaster. Moreover, using recordings with mixed stimuli I have found that sweet taste receptors in Drosophila are directly inhibited by bitte alkaloids. This mechanism may be evolutionarily conserved since labellar sweet taste neurons in An. gambiae and Ae. aegypti are inhibited by alkaloids as well.
The proposed project is innovative because this is the first report of successful expression of sweet taste receptors in a heterologous neuron in vivo. The hypothesis is that each receptor in both D. melanogaster and An. gambiae can individually respond to a unique set of sweet compounds and is inhibited by a distinct set of alkaloids.
The rationale is that by understanding how insect taste receptors detect attractive and aversive compounds, we can then screen for novel compounds that can be used in insect control strategies. These studies will lay the foundation to probe structure-function relationships of sweet receptors in Drosophila and An. gambiae in terms of detection of chemicals of both sweet and bitter categories with opposing effects on receptor activity. The significance of the proposed project is that it will advance our understanding of a highly conserved insect chemoreceptor family and establish a system to study insect gustatory receptor function by ectopic expression.
Public health relevance: Sugar-baited lethal traps are an effective method to control the spread of mosquitoes, yet little is known about how insects use sweet gustatory receptors to detect sweet compounds. The proposed studies will identify a functional sweet receptor complex in the model insect, D. melanogaster, and identify and characterize selected sweet taste receptors of the malaria mosquito An. gambiae by expressing them in the fruit-fly. These studies will provide a foundation to decode taste receptors from other insects and to find novel targets to identify compounds that could be used in insect control strategies.

Dahanukar,,"The ability to detect various chemicals and to use this information to make feeding decisions is a defining feature of the taste system from humans to insects. In Drosophila, a large family of Gustatory receptor (Gr) genes encodes divergent receptors that are expressed in taste neurons. Despite ongoing efforts, we know little about the ligand response profiles of individual Gr proteins in any insect. Gr proteins represent a novel family, distantly related only to insect Odorant receptor (Or) proteins, and thus lack the advantage of structural or functional comparisons with equivalent groups. The same feature of exclusivity in insects and arthropods, however, makes Grs attractive targets for developing novel strategies of insect control.
In preliminary studies, we have developed an in vivo functional expression system in which to identify the response properties of individual insect Grs. The proposed research is innovative because it employs a novel in vivo ectopic expression system for decoding Gr function and combines it with molecular genetics, electrophysiological, and behavioural analyses of gustatory function. The research is significant because functional analysis of Gr genes will contribute to our understanding of the fundamental principles by which tastants are encoded across a diverse repertoire of receptors and how mechanisms of tastant detection translate to food selection. Additionally, our studies will shed light on molecular and cellular mechanisms of sugar detection in mosquitoes, which may be applicable for improving sugar-baited traps that are used in mosquito surveillance and control strategies.
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Feeding activity of insects is responsible for transmission of deadly diseases such as malaria, dengue fever and West Nile fever, and for billions of dollars in crop losses each year. Detection of compounds by taste receptors plays a significant role in informing the palatability of food sources. The proposed research is relevant to public health because studies of the functional properties of insect taste receptors will be critical for understanding the mechanisms that control insect feeding behaviour. 
","The overarching objective of this proposal is to elucidate functional properties of individual taste receptors in Drosophila and the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae, and their role in instructing feeding behaviour.
We propose to systematically characterize the tuning profiles of selected taste receptors of the fruit fly and the mosquito by taking advantage of our ectopic expression system. The experiments are designed to reveal fundamental features of Gr function including the activation and inhibition profiles of individual receptors, the extent of functional overlap between receptors, and the relationship between receptor sequence and function.
The approach to address these questions will be to:
Identify the tuning profiles of internally expressed Drosophila taste receptors, and evaluate their roles in feeding behaviour by genetic analysis,
Characterize novel cross-modality interactions between Drosophila sweet taste receptors and bitter tastants, and examine the functional role of sweet taste neuron inhibition in feeding behaviour, and
Identify activators and inhibitors of putative sweet taste receptors of An. gambiae and characterize the response profiles of endogenous sweet taste neurons in the mosquito proboscis.
Studies of sweet taste receptors in the fly and mosquito may provide novel targets to identify compounds for improving outdoor traps such as sugar-baited traps, which are used for mosquito surveillance and control.",Entomology,

Due to this, CO2 is considered to be one of the best baits for luring host-seeking mosquitoes in disease vector surveillance and mosquito control programs. Current sources of CO2 have various limitations; and therefore, there is a need for finding a cheaper source of CO2. The action of yeast on sugar cane blackstrap molasses (hereinafter referred simply as molasses) has been proven to produce ample amounts of CO2 that can be used to lure mosquitoes as documented by Mweresa et al (2014). At the same time in the agricultural sector, it has already been documented that unfermented molasses diluted in water and mixed with effective microorganisms can be used for enriching the soil with organic nutrients like nitrogen and potassium.
In the project, the efficacy of yeast-molasses fermentation as an alternative source of carbon dioxide was tested against yeast sugar fermentation and industrial carbon dioxide sources. Experiments were conducted in Lupiro Village, Ulanga District, in southeast Tanzania. Four odour-baited stations (OBS) were placed 30 meters apart and baited with CO2 generated from either yeast-sugar fermentation, yeast-molasses fermentation, industrial CO2 or a control trap (D) that was un-baited.
The trap baited with industrial CO2 (250 ml/min) caught the most mosquitoes, followed by the trap baited with CO2 generated by molasses (from a mixture of 40g of dry yeast, 0.25L of molasses and 1.5L of tap water in each 1.5L bottle), the trap with CO2 generated by yeast-sugar and the unbaited trap. Micro-garden plots were then established to test whether yeast-molasses fermentation residues could be used to enrich vegetable gardens.
Outcome: Even though the yeast-molasses fermentation is not as efficient as the industrial CO2 gas, the fact that all the materials required are locally available makes it a more convenient and cheap alternative to industrial, yeast-sugar fermentation and ice sources of carbon dioxide. The study also found that yeast-molasses fermentation residue can act as a soil-enriching agent for vegetable micro gardens. Results showed that seeds treated with molasses fermentation residues germinated and sprouted faster than those in the urea treated and control chambers. Vegetable production was also enhanced in gardens treated with the residue.
The project team intends to apply for Transition To Scale (TTS) funding, to conduct further tests on yeast-molasses residues.

Plasmodium knowlesi is the most common cause of malaria, and malaria deaths, in Sabah, Malaysia. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common feature of severe knowlesi malaria; however, the mechanisms of AKI in knowlesi malaria are unknown. In falciparum malaria, recent evidence suggests that oxidative stress from haemolysis-related cell-free haemoglobin (CFHb) may contribute to the pathogenesis of AKI.
The investigators hypothesise that paracetamol may provide renal protection in patients with severe knowlesi malaria by reducing the hemoprotein-induced lipid peroxidation that occurs in haemolytic conditions. As there is currently no consensus that exists concerning adequate medical treatment for severe malaria complicated by intravascular haemolysis and AKI, the potential application of paracetamol would be of great benefit, especially as it is safe and widely available.
The main activity proposed is a randomised, open-label, controlled trial of regularly-dosed paracetamol, versus no paracetamol, in patients with knowlesi malaria, to assess the effect of paracetamol on renal function and oxidative stress.

Früh,,"The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a sterilising vaccine against malaria. The specific hypothesis tested in this proposal is that sterilising immunity against malaria can be achieved by induction of a lasting effector memory T cell (TEM) response targeting the liver stage of Plasmodium parasites. Repeated immunisations with live or irradiated sporozoites are known to protect vaccinated individuals against malaria challenge. Recent evidence suggests that this protection correlated with the presence of frequent pluripotent TEM, suggesting that permanent sterilising immunity against malaria requires the induction of high levels of long-lived TEM by vaccination. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use recombinant cytomegalovirus (CMV) as a vaccine vector because CMV is the prototypical virus inducing long-lived TEM that do not show signs of T cell exhaustion. This unique capability of CMV-vectors was recently applied to induce long-lived TEM against simian immunodeficiency virus, resulting in protection against SIV-challenge that was by far superior to conventional heterologous prime/boost vaccines with respect to efficacy and duration. Since sterilising protection against Plasmodium knowlesi parasites was only partial and shortlived when heterologous prime/boost vaccines were used, we will examine whether CMV-derived vaccine vectors will similarly confer lasting and efficacious immunity against challenge with Plasmodium knowlesi (Pk) sporozoites. We propose to generate recombinant RhCMV expressing four Pk antigens previously used for heterologous prime-boost vaccination: the circumsporozoite protein (CSP), the sporozoite surface protein 2 or thrombospondin-related adhesion protein (SSP2 or TRAP), the apical merozoite antigen-1 (AMA1) and the C-terminus of the merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1c). We will inoculate animals with this panel of four recombinant RhCMV/Pk vectors and monitor the development of TEM in blood, lung and liver.

Voelker,,"Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is an essential lipid in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans and a pivotal enzyme in the production of this phospholipid is phosphatidylserine decarboxylase (PSD). Although the deduced primary structure of eukaryotic PSD has been known for more than a decade, the details about how the activity of this enzyme is regulated have been elusive. In addition, PSD belongs to an unusual family of enzymes that contain a pyruvoyl prosthetic group. Progress in understanding eukaryotic PSD enzymes has been hampered by its integral membrane structure and relative lability in the presence of detergents. Recently, we cloned a cDNA encoding PSD from the parasite Plasmodium knowlesi (PkPSD). The PkPSD exists in both soluble and membrane bound forms. The availability of soluble forms of PkPSD has now enabled new lines of inquiry into the structure and function of this enzyme. Using coupled in vitro transcription/ translation systems we have begun to dissect the early events that regulate the conversion of nascent proenzyme to the mature enzyme, consisting of a small subunit containing the pyruvoyl prosthetic group, and a large subunit. We have now devised a system for examining the in vitro processing of the proenzyme to the mature enzyme, and have succeeded in expressing high levels of the proenzyme in bacteria. Utilizing these systems we now plan to conduct experimentation to elucidate the mechanisms of proenzyme processing and post translational regulation of catalytic activity. From these studies, we will obtain a comprehensive view of how the lipid composition of cell membranes allosterically influences the activation of an essential enzyme in phospholipid synthesis. Understanding this aspect of PSD regulation coupled to membrane lipid composition will have important consequences for intervening in phospholipid metabolism of pathogens and mammalian cells with unregulated growth.

Moon,Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV),"The parasites produce a range of adhesive proteins enabling them to bind to specific proteins on the surface of red blood cells and establish the process of red blood cell invasion. Because of their crucial role in the invasion process these parasite proteins are important vaccine targets. They also determine how effectively parasites can replicate and so can affect disease severity as well as determining which hosts are susceptible to malaria.
In this project I will investigate the role of these proteins during the invasion process using a malaria parasite known as Plasmodium knowlesi. I will use highly efficient techniques to genetically modify the parasite and generate parasites in which I have deleted genes encoding the adhesive proteins. This will enable me to determine which are essential for invasion and which can be deleted without any effect on the invasion process. Using similar techniques I will also add fluorescent ""tags"" to each of the proteins coded by the target genes, so that I can determine where the adhesive proteins are in the cell and where they move during the invasion process. The ""tags"" will also allow me to identify parasite proteins that interact with the adhesive proteins as well as what they specifically bind to on the host red blood cell surface.
This will provide critical insight into the mechanism of invasion of all malaria parasites, as well as identifying precisely which parasite proteins and host proteins are required for P. knowlesi to invade human red blood cells. The latter is of particular importance as it may explain how a macaque malaria parasite is able to spread to infect humans and determine the potential for emergence of human-to-human transmission of the parasite.

Greater than 100 species of malaria exist, infecting many different animals. Until recently, humans were thought to be the natural hosts for 4 malaria species. However, since 2004 reports appeared of malaria infections in humans that are caused by a parasite species found previously in certain types of macaque in Southeast Asia. This species is Plasmodium knowlesi and, although benign in its natural monkey host, it has caused severe and even fatal disease in a proportion of human sufferers.
Currently, we know little about the true burden of disease caused by this macaque parasite, or why it has emerged as a human pathogen. Initial descriptions of humans with Plasmodium knowlesi malaria suggested that they had been bitten and infected while working in forested areas, common in many countries of Southeast Asia. However, a more recent study in Malaysian Borneo shows that communities there are also being infected, even though there is little forest in existence. There may be a number of factors related to the environment, the types of mosquito in the area, people?s behaviour or movement and their proximity to troops of macaques that will have an effect on how at risk they are to being infected with Plasmodium knowlesi.
We have built a network of researchers with different skills and expertise from the UK, the Philippines, Malaysia and Australia to tackle the various knowledge gaps by working together in a concerted approach. We plan to conduct studies in both the Philippines (on Palawan island) and in Sabah, a region of Malaysian Borneo. A larger number of cases of human Plasmodium knowlesi infection have been found in Sabah, compared to Palawan, and we will attempt to find out why communities here seem at higher risk. In treating their infections we can produce guidelines to help other clinicians faced with this disease. We also want to study the macaques, the mosquitoes that transmit the parasite, and the environment in which the infections occur to give us the whole picture and to produce maps that describe the risk factors existing in the different areas. We hope this will provide important information to ministries of health trying to control malaria disease in the affected regions and prevent further outbreaks of malaria originating from primates.
Methods: We propose an interdisciplinary approach to examine the extent of infection with P. knowlesi at 2 study sites and to identify risk factors for infection that ultimately contribute to its control. A case control study, the first of its kind for P. knowlesi, will allow analysis of broad scale spatial and socio-behavioural factors associated with symptomatic infections. Alongside this we will conduct detailed entomological trapping experiments and primatology studies within habitats of potential epidemiological importance (closed canopy primary forest, secondary forest, etc.). These data together with mosquito and macaque infection rates will be incorporated into spatial and mathematical models to generate risk maps for P. knowlesi infection. We will use these maps to define areas in which to conduct cross sectional surveys to identify asymptomatic infections and exposure patterns with P. knowlesi.

There is a dearth of a robust malaria surveillance system. This situation was aggravated by the deviation of resources to monitor the Ebola epidemics.  Interruption of malaria control during the Ebola epidemic posed the risk to promote changes in susceptibility to malaria. These potential changes represent a reason for closely monitoring of malaria trends.  The last Malaria Indicator Survey (MIS) in Liberia was conducted in 2011. Such population-based approaches require logistically complex collection of biological samples. In contrast, pregnant women are a group of relatively easy access through ANC. In a context such as Liberia, where surveys such as MIS cannot be easily conducted, having timely first-hand prevalence data from pregnant women might have an added value as a proxy to prevalence rates of malaria at community-level.  Knowledge on the distribution of antimalarial resistances would be critical to inform the Liberian Ministry of Health and Social Welfare on the expected efficacy of IPTp. Monitoring molecular markers of resistance (e.g. Kelch13) in parasites isolated from pregnant women in their first visit to ANC could help provide estimates of resistance to Artemisinin-based first-line treatment.  In particular for post-Ebola Liberia, continued vigilance of the malaria burden will be critical to assess whether there is an increasing trend of malaria incidence in urban areas, and whether this trend is followed by an increase in the frequency of severe malaria syndromes.  Understanding the determinants of changing trends in malaria prevalence, as well as the timescales over which antimalarial immunity is gained and lost, is a priority to prevent reinfection and resurgence of malaria infections. In this regard, this study aims to assess malaria prevalence in pregnant women attending ANC, under the assumption that molecular testing and pregnancy-specific serology may be a more effective sentinel-based approach to estimate the burden of malaria than conventional microscopy and RDT. Several evidences point to IgG against VAR2CSA (the parasite antigen that mediates sequestration of P. falciparum in the placenta) as a marker of cumulative exposure to P. falciparum during pregnancy that can provide estimates of malaria transmission (Mayor et al., 2015). ISGlobal has developed an approach to monitor malaria burden which is based on the pathophysiology of malaria in pregnancy. Malaria in pregnancy is characterized by a massive accumulation of P. falciparum infected erythrocytes in the intervillous space of the placenta. Knowledge of the parasite antigen mediating this sequestration (VAR2CSA) has provided us the principle to develop a pregnancy-serological tool for the assessment of malaria transmission.  Antibodies against VAR2CSA are developed after exposure to placental parasites in a parity-dependent manner (i.e., increase with exposure during successive pregnancies).   Antibodies against VAR2CSA are affected by variables that influence the risk of exposure to P. falciparum such as season, proximity to the river, use of IPTp or ITN. Serological parameters with parity stratification may be used to determine recent and past changes in transmission intensity in women pregnant for the first time and in those with more than a previous pregnancy.
 This study is proposed by a team of investigators affiliated to Saint Joseph?s Catholic Hospital (Liberia), Fundación Juan Ciudad (FJC) (Spain), ISGlobal (Spain) and CISM (Mozambique).   Overall, this study is expected to provide baseline information on prevalence of malaria in an urban post-Ebola Liberian context and to contribute to shift the current paradigm of pregnant women as a vulnerable group to that of a population with potential to serve for the real-time monitoring of malaria transmission utilizing molecular and serological tools with enough sensitivity to guide malaria control activities.
The purpose of this study is to apply innovative laboratory-based approaches to assess malaria burden among pregnant women attending ANC services for the first time during their pregnancy in a Hospital integrated in the National Health System, in Monrovia, Liberia.   
This is a observational mixed-methods cross-sectional study in design. It has received approval from the University of Liberia Institutional Review Committee and it will be conducted between August 2016-July 2017.

There is a strong sense of urgency to develop effective mosquito control measures due to the development of antimalarial drug resistance in Southeast Asia. Mosquitoes that transmit malaria in Southeast Asia feed primarily outdoors and often times early in the evening. This makes it difficult to protect people from malaria-transmitting mosquitoes with bed nets and insecticides sprayed on houses, therefore we require novel mosquito control interventions for use in Southeast Asia. The drug ivermectin is widely used in veterinary and human medicine to treat internal (e.g. worms) and external (e.g. ticks, scabies, and lice) parasites. Ivermectin is an exceptionally safe drug and in Africa, it is given to entire villages for treatment of the worms that cause River Blindness. It has been shown that ivermectin is lethal to important malaria-transmitting mosquitoes in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Following mass drug administration (MDA) of ivermectin in Africa, it was demonstrated that ivermectin reduces wild mosquito survivorship and suppresses malaria transmission. Ivermectin MDAs in Southeast Asia would make people lethal to blood-feeding mosquitoes which would directly target outdoor-feeding mosquitoes. Now we propose to test whether ivermectin MDA to people in Southeast Asia can kill wild mosquitoes and suppress malaria transmission.
Ivermectin is used in Southeast Asia but is not given by MDA. Currently antimalarial drugs, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and primaquine, are given by MDA to cure people of their malaria parasites. The combination of ivermectin and antimalarial drug MDAs would simultaneously suppress malaria transmission and clear populations of their malaria parasites. In Thailand and Kenya, clinical trials are being conducted to assess the safety, tolerability, drug-drug interactions, and mosquito-killing properties of ivermectin, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine, and primaquine.
People would benefit from this study by having reduced malaria cases. In addition, ivermectin MDAs would affect many other parasites, thus delivering a public health intervention that extends beyond malaria control, which may help maintain higher compliance rates with MDAs. Results from this study could be used to justify conducting ivermectin or multi-drug MDAs in other areas of Southeast Asia for malaria elimination. Antimalarial drug resistance is developing in Southeast Asia thus malaria elimination is very important in this region to prevent the catastrophic spread of these resistant parasites to other regions, especially Africa.
","The main objective of this project is to work in a malaria endemic region of Southern Thailand for four years to characterize malaria transmission in humans and mosquitoes, before, during, and after MDAs. Several villages will be treated with ivermectin MDA and the reduction in malaria transmission will be assessed. The next year villages will be treated with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and primaquine or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine and primaquine and ivermectin to assess if these drug combinations are safe and if MDAs with ivermectin accelerate malaria elimination.","Basic science, Entomology","Drug resistance, Drug-based strategies, Elimination strategies, Measurement of transmission, Tools for elimination"

Between 2009 and 2012, demand for approved ACTs increased by around 170%. Artemisinin is extracted from Artemisia annua, the sweet wormwood plant grown in Asia, Southeast Asia, Europe Africa and South America.
To stabilise the supply of artemisinin and respond to the threat of shortages, UNITAID?s Assured Artemisinin Supply Service project aims to increase the global supply of artemisinin.
Launched in 2009, this project encourages farmers to grow Artemisia annua and incentivize extractors to sell artemisinin to manufacturers of ACTs. Since the growing, harvesting, extracting and producing of artemisinin takes about 18 months, farmers need incentives to grow the plant in place of other agricultural products. Through agreements between artemisinin extractors, prequalified ACT manufactures and i+solutions (a supply chain management NGO), UNITAID provides loans to artemisinin extractors so the artemisinin supply can meet demand. Pre-financing from UNITAID allows extractors to purchase additional stocks of Artemisia annua and increase production of refined artemisinin.

In March 2011, UNITAID?s Executive Board voted to not approve an extension to this project and conduct an orderly closure.
The implementer is currently developing a new project plan to complete ongoing activities and support the market intelligence component of the project. A detailed plan is being developed for recovering loans, delivering contracted Artemisinin. No further loans have been approved.

At its January 2009 ad hoc meeting in Geneva, the UNITAID Board mandated the UNITAID Secretariat to commission such forecasting services. The Secretariat, recognizing the need to include related activities, broadened the service to include artemisinin and ACT supply and demand forecasting at both the global level and for the Affordable Medicines Facility - malaria (AMFm).  
Since the launch of this project, the quarterly demand forecasts have become a valuable tool in supporting a healthy malaria market by providing insights to policy makers and signals to market participants. With the end of Phase 1, ongoing market uncertainties threatening the stability of ACT and artemisinin supply, as well as the unknown market impact of the availability of quality-assured RDTs, UNITAID commenced Phase 2 of this project. In Phase 2, the scope of the forecasting project has been broadened to include malaria RDTs in light of their emerging role in improving case management and in diminishing inappropriate (presumptive) use of ACTs for patients who do not have malaria, and artemisinin monotherapies including injectable artesunate and rectal artesunate for severe malaria. Phase 2 builds on the principles and processes of Phase 1, notably quarterly reporting with regular updating of assumptions based on newly available data; harmonizing multiple approaches and triangulating outputs from different models; and creating demand estimates for different scenarios that reflect a range of possible future situations.
Through this continued investment, UNITAID is committed to maintaining a global forecasting service to ensure reliable and timely information is collected and communicated to all actors in the supply chain.

This grant will be implemented by the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV), the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) and the Malaria Consortium.  
Challenge and market shortcomings:  
Out of 219 million estimated annual malaria cases, approximately eight million are severe. Typically, children diagnosed in hospitals with severe malaria are given intravenous (IV) quinine. It is a cumbersome process: the IV drip needs to be changed every eight hours and treatment can last seven days. With a shortage of health workers in endemic countries, the need for such intense monitoring puts a high burden on the health care system and increases the risk for patients.  
Clinical trials results published in 2010 showed that injectable artesunate is 22.5% more efficacious than quinine in reducing mortality in children. Artesunate can be administered rapidly through IV injection over 3-5 minutes or as an injection. Only two doses are administered on the first day of treatment, and the drug is given once daily thereafter. Despite being recommended by the WHO since 2011, several market shortcomings have limited the use of injectable artesunate. Inadequate advocacy, education and training have lead to poor acceptance by patients and healthcare providers. Injectable artesunate costs three times more than injectable quinine, due to the low volume manufactured and the lack of competition. Currently, there is only one WHO prequalified supplier of injectable artesunate.  
Market Intervention:  
MMV and UNITAID will create a market for injectable artesunate and introduce it as an alternative to quinine for the treatment of severe malaria. MMV will also encourage the market entry of a second supplier of injectable artesunate through negotiation in order to increase competition. To ensure that children are given a chance to reach hospital for treatment of severe malaria, this grant will also support the market entry of rectal artesunate. A community health worker or a mother can administer these suppositories; in effect, ?buying time? while the child is transported to hospital. Currently, no rectal artesunate product has been WHO-prequalified or approved by a stringent regulatory authority, despite being recommended by the WHO for the pre-referral treatment of severe malaria. This project will provide technical support to manufacturers of artesunate suppositories so that they can attain regulatory approval of the product.

"Insect Parasitic Nematode, Romanomermis iyengari, in Malaria Control",http://www.grandchallenges.ca/grantee-stars/0122-01/#description,Project,,,Benin,,"Grand Challenges Canada, National University of Benin",,"National Polytechnic Institute (CIIDIR), Oaxaca, University of California, Riverside",National University of Benin,Thiery Alavo,"National Polytechnic Institute (CIIDIR), Oaxaca, University of California, Riverside","Background. The mermithid nematode Romanomermis iyengari is one of several natural control alternatives to synthetic pesticides for mosquito suppression. The commonly used mass rearing procedure of R. iyengari involves the use of coarse sand as a substrate for nematode maturation and oviposition. The coarse sand technique gives excellent nematode productivity in North America. However, under West African climatic conditions, this technique generates relatively lesser amounts of infectious worms. We evaluated coconut coir fibres as a replacement for coarse sand to improve yields in largescale production of R. iyengari in Benin, West Africa.
Materials and Methods. Culex quinquefasciatus was the host for the nematodes, and mosquitoes were blood-fed on chickens. Four days after blood feeding, egg rafts were collected and transferred into trays, each containing 2 l of water. The mosquito larvae were fed with fish food. When the mosquito larvae reached the second instar, preparasites (J2) were added (3 J2/larva) to the incubation trays. Eight days after infection, post-parasitic juveniles were separated from the water containing dead mosquito larvae and other debris using sieves and needles; 2 g of them were deposited in containers with coarse sand or coconut coir fibres and water. Three hours later, the water was drained, the jars covered and stored for eight weeks, after which J2 abundance was determined, using a total of 320 containers for each substrate. The abundance of J2 preparasites was also assessed 3-5 months after storage to determine the impact of long-term storage on the J2 yield.
Results. After 2 months storage, 2 g of post-parasites (~457 females and 583 males) yielded an average of 559,300±6094 J2 and 155,818±4427 J2 per container for coconut fibres and for coarse sand, respectively. During long-term storage, yields of J2 on coconut fibres substrate slowly decreased from 442,180±9322 J2 (3 months storage) to 163,632±12,416 J2 per container (5 months storage). On coarse sand substrate, the yield was relatively low and decreased from 49,812±1200 J2 at 3 months storage to 3046±229 J2 at 5 months storage.
Conclusion. Under West African climatic conditions, coconut coir fibres gave significantly higher preparasitic nematode yields than the coarse sand technique.

The way the funnel is inserted in the cage allows mosquitoes to enter easily but prevents them from escaping.
The project team worked with a local window manufacturer to improve the design of existing traps to fit into local houses, developed six prototypes and tested four of them in two ecological settings (high- versus low-vector density). The most promising prototype was selected and then deployed in a case-control study in two villages (one village was an intervention village and the other was a control). A total of eight houses in the control village were selected to install the traps at windows and to assess their performances against that of the intervention village. Mosquito density was followed up monthly for four months.
Outcome: At individual houses, the Lehmann?s trap performed very well in both the intervention and control village, as mosquito density in individually equipped houses with traps was reduced by 78%?96% throughout the four-month study period. Assessment of the impact of the trap on vector density at the community level showed a 68% reduction in August and 55.5% in October, but there was no reduction in September.

Eliminating the submicroscopic reservoir of Plasmodium infections in asymptomatic carriers is likely to play a critical role in the elimination of malaria. Until recently, asymptomatic carriage was considered to be insignificant in low-transmission settings but studies utilising high-volume PCR have been able to detect a significant burden of malaria parasites at levels well below the detection limit of RDTs and light microscopy in these settings. Assessment by calibration with spiked samples shows the limit of detection of these approaches and highlights the need for more sensitive detection of low-density parasites. The use of filter paper sampling for PCR has been assessed in the field as a means of improving sensitivity but maintaining ease of sampling with finger-prick blood samples. Such samples use approximately 5 ?L of blood and can detect parasite densities of greater than 200 parasites/ml).
It is now well established that transmission can occur at parasite densities that are well below the threshold of detection by RDTs and LM, and that there is a need for tools with enhanced sensitivity to identify individuals with low parasitaemias who may be at risk of progressing to clinical disease but who also contribute to a parasite ?reservoir? and ongoing transmission.
Once established, such tools could be used to directly implement either Focal Screen and Treat (FSaT) strategies in which only parasite positive individuals are treated. However the surveillance data can also be used to implement broader Mass Screen and Treat (MSaT) strategies or to guide a targeted Mass Drug Administration (tMDA) approach. Thus the development of these diagnostic tools is important in their own right, irrespective of the responses that follow subsequently.
It is unclear, which technical approaches are ideal for detecting low density parasitaemias especially in remote settings, and how they can be implemented in a cost-effective and timely manner. Most approaches are seeking to assess some form of nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), most commonly polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). LAMP has particular appeal because it does not require the use of a thermocycler and can theoretically be established with only minimal infrastructure and training. It has been well validated in Africa and South America but there have been no comprehensive assessments in Vietnam, Cambodia, or Laos. LAMP methods utilise whole blood samples or dried blood spot (DBS) samples collected on filter papers. The former is likely to yield greater sensitivity due to the higher volume of blood used, but the latter is likely to be quicker and more easily deployed in the field. These two approaches have not been compared in a field setting. These methods will be compared with real-time PCR and light microscopy.
Overall goal:
The overall goal of this activity is to evaluate the feasibility of implementing LAMP-based testing in rural Vietnam.
Project methodology:
Two staff will independently read the LAMP results visually (turbidity and UV fluorescence) and using the LA-500 turbidimeter. The rationale for the visual read is to try and ultimately overcome the need for high-cost technologies like the turbidimeter.
Samples will be sent for real-time PCR and light microscopy to establish the performance of the LAMP assays against these widely accepted standards. At this stage RDT will not be included because the additional expense and because the literature clearly indicates that they will not sensitive enough in this context.
At the end of study, the different LAMP methods will be compared with the light microscopy and real-time PCR methods to establish parasite prevalence using this approach to Re-Active Case Detection.

Richards, Sara E. Canavati, Thang Ngo Duc","National Institute of Malaria, Parasitology, and Entomology (NIMPE), Vietnam","Background:
The movement of populations between malaria-endemic areas is believed to be a major contributor to the spread of artemisinin resistance along the Vietnam-Cambodia border. Cross-border transmission also represents a challenge for malaria elimination as reintroduction of the disease into ?malaria-free? areas undermines these efforts. Populations crossing the border tend to be poorly connected to health systems, and their high mobility makes them difficult to track. They are also at higher risk of harbouring parasites due to the type of activities that they normally perform (e.g. forest and plantation work).
Interventions at borders have typically targeted formal border crossings. Economic migrants and high-risk communities living in border regions typically use unofficial border crossings however due to easier access when looking for work opportunities in forests, plantations and farms.
Current screening at official borders is based on eliciting a history of fever and followed by RDT or microscopy confirmation. The yield from such screening approaches has been low. This partly indicates that symptomatic individuals are less likely to be travelling, but also highlights that there needs to be greater focus on screening asymptomatic individuals crossing borders. The need for diagnostics with sufficient sensitivity to detect the low parasite densities typically seen in asymptomatic individuals has already been highlighted and is addressed in Activity 5.3. There is also a need for these diagnostics tests to have a rapid turn around time so that results and treatment can be administered in a timely manner. There is also a need to determine the volume of drug-resistant parasites transiting these border regions.
Overall goal:
This activity aims to implement high sensitivity and rapid screening at unofficial borders between Vietnam and Cambodia to reduce the cross border transit of malaria. It will link border-screening activities to the in-country surveillance systems and establish monitoring of drug resistant malaria parasites for these groups.
Project methodology:
MOTs will commence screening to determine the extent of transmission, identify hotspots, and provide treatment to positive cases. Mobile Outreach Teams will deploy for 1-2 days to passively monitor the number of persons crossing through the border crossing or transit point. Should it be established that the crossing/transit point is active, the location will be geo-tagged the MOTs will begin a 1-2 day voluntary active case screening of border crossers/transiting persons at the location. Up to 5500 individuals will be invited to participate by having a brief clinical history, temperature recorded and finger prick samples taken for thick/ thin smear, filter paper collection and microtainer lithium heparin blood sample collected (up to 300ul). Any symptomatic individual will still be eligible to be enrolled, but will also receive routine care for malaria according to National treatment guidelines, including diagnosis with RDT (and/ or microscopy) and to receive appropriate antimalarial treatment. Any study participant identified by LAMP will be followed up by the local MOT team and offered treatment according to the National treatment guidelines.

Canavati, Jack S. Richards, Thang Ngo Duc","National Institute of Malaria, Parasitology, and Entomology (NIMPE), Vietnam","Background
The goal of malaria elimination in low transmission settings requires a shift from early diagnosis and treatment of symptomatic individuals to a strategy of enhanced surveillance in which there is Active Case Detection (ACD). A particular variant of this approach is that of Re-Active Case Detection (RACD) which involves following up on index cases. Follow up includes enhanced testing of individuals in the same household, neighbourhood, or peers of the index case. This intensified but focal approach is justified by the known heterogeneity of transmission in low transmission settings; so called ?hot spots?.
Although ACD is a recommended intervention in low transmission settings, evidence for its effectiveness is sparse. There are also different ACD strategies that can be used to guide a range of responses. The approaches of interest in this project involve either: 1) a process of diagnostic screening and then treating positives (i.e. either mass screen and treat or focal screen and treat) or 2) targeted mass drug administration without prior screening. There is a need to determine the efficacy and operational feasibility of these approaches in different epidemiological settings.
Potential limitations of these different ACD approaches to impact transmission is likely to be determined by the operational challenges of achieving high coverage for these approaches, the continued importation of parasites, and the ability of current field diagnostics to detect very low density infections by using a nucleic acid amplification method called loop-mediated isothermal amplification or LAMP).
Overall goal:
To develop interventional tools and approaches to actively screen households that have an index malaria case and to implement treatment to eliminate the asymptomatic reservoir of parasites.
Project methodology:
Confirmed index cases of malaria will be identified and mapped using our GIS mapping system. Due to the expected low/sub-microscopic parasitemic levels in these provinces, we propose that individuals living in households of a confirmed index case will be followed up and invited to enroll in a randomised study of either hMDA or FSAT.
One hundred index cases will be identified and for each case, up to 20 individuals living in the same household or peers of the index case will be invited to participate (i.e. total n=2000). Each individual will be randomised to hMDA or FSAT. All participants will have a brief clinical history taken, temperature recorded and finger prick samples obtained for thick/ thin smear, filter paper collection and microtainer lithium heparin blood sample collected (up to 300ul). These samples will be used for LAMP, microscopy, malaria serology and real-time PCR (at Burnet Institute). Those randomised to hMDA will receive a treatment course of ACT according to National Guidelines without the test results being available. Those randomised to FSAT will only be offered treatment if found to be parasite positive by LAMP or microscopy. LAMP testing will be performed on the hMDA group also but the results will not determine treatment.
Any symptomatic individual will be assessed by RDT or microscopy and will receive routine care for malaria according to National treatment guidelines if appropriate. Permission will be sought to also collect the blood samples outlined above.
Screening and collection of samples will be conducted by both VHMs and commune health personnel. Questionnaires will be filled in to capture data that may explain how foci of asymptomatic parasitaemia changes according to risk factors such as proximity to forest, age, or occupational activities of the household members. Identified cases will be geo-referenced to assess the potential spatio-temporal relationship of asymptomatic cases following the detection of an index symptomatic case. Any parasite positive samples will be included in the genetic epidemiology study (Activity 4.2).
The following parameters will be determined:
Proportion of infected (by LAMP and PCR) in households where a malaria case has been reported.
Proportion of infected individuals with malaria parasites in index households according to distance to forest, location and occupation of the head of household
Cost, resources/personnel needed and time spent for hMDA vs. FSAT

Richards, Sara E. Canavati, Thang Ngo Duc","National Institute of Malaria, Parasitology, and Entomology (NIMPE), Vietnam","Background:
The emergence and spread of resistance to artemisinin and ACT partner drugs in the GMS is threatening to reverse the recent gains in malaria control.
The recent increase in multidrug resistant falciparum malaria has rendered the infection very difficult to treat in Western Cambodia and Northern Cambodia, with high failure rates to AM-LUM, AAS-MQ, DHA-PQP and Proguanil-Amodiaquine. Successful elimination will require a particular focus on identifying hotspots of drug resistant parasites and focusing tailored responses against these parasites. The following strategies will be required:
rapidly identify, characterise and act upon outbreak of drug resistant parasites.
monitor resistance patterns in real-time to inform drug policy.
reconstruct geographical patterns of spread, so that these can be interrupted by targeted interventions.
Overall goal:
To integrate genetic epidemiology as a routine part of epidemiological surveillance, and incorporate the acquisition of near-real-time data from conventional and genetic epidemiology into decision-making on drug policies and intervention priorities for malaria elimination.
Project Overview
The proposed genetic surveillance system utilises the existing network of community-based health workers to establish a system for DBS collection and transport from Tier 1 areas in Vietnam. This genetic surveillance system will accelerate the assessment of artemisinin resistance at a village level.
Project Methodology
The GIS mapping conducted in the dry season (November-December 2015) will provide the geo-spatial foundation for the genetic epidemiology surveillance. Routine data collection of malaria cases from MOTs and VHWs will be collected in real-time using mobile phone uploads integrated into the Spatial Decision Support System to generate real-time reporting to NIMPE to inform strategic targeted actions for the control of transmission foci and for malaria elimination. MOTs and VMWs will also collect dried blood spots (DBS), thick/thin films and a microtainer of blood from finger-prick samples according to the specific SOPs. This will be performed for all patients that test positive for P. falciparum or mixed malaria infection by microscopy or RDT.
These samples will be used to establish the presence of various drug resistance markers, such as K13 mutations, as well as markers for MDR genetic background and others. These results will be provided to NIMPE as a regular monthly report in a format mutually agreed upon by the Recon Project and NIMPE. These data will then be integrated into the SDSS.

Richards, Sara E. Canavati, Thang Ngo Duc","National Institute of Malaria, Parasitology, and Entomology (NIMPE), Vietnam","Background:
Serology is a common surveillance tool for a wide range of infectious diseases. Cross sectional surveys and prospective cohort studies can be used to monitor changes in disease exposure at a population and individual level. Malaria surveillance however, has generally only measured current infection or entomological parameters, with the former focusing on rates of parasitaemia measured by light microscopy, rapid diagnostic tests and nucleic acid amplification. Each of these approaches may have limitations in precision, sensitivity, time-costs, required technical expertise, throughput, and financial costs. Seroepidemiology is increasingly recognised as cheap, low cost approach that can also provide highly sensitivity detection of recent parasite infection in symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Simple blood collection from finger-prick samples means that sampling can be rapid and non-invasive. Antibodies can be measured by ELISA-based methodologies that are high-throughout, low cost and can be performed locally.
Project Overview:
Even sensitive detection methods like nucleic acid amplification may fail to detect individuals exposed to Plasmodium infection because of limitations in sensitivity and frequency of testing. Immunological responses however, are acquired even with infections of low parasitaemia. Immunological responses remain detectable for weeks to months and thus can be used as a highly sensitive tool to detect parasite exposure over a preceding block of time, and not just reflecting current infection.
This activity will build upon the sample collection system outlined in Activity 4.1 and will develop capacity to undertake serological testing for a range of malaria antigens at NIMPE. Although this approach is well established as a research tool, it needs to be evaluated as a strategy that is integrated into a National surveillance program and to determine its usefulness in guiding malaria elimination responses. This will provide a new tool to track changes in exposure at a population level over time and monitor the impact of malaria elimination interventions. It has also been demonstrated that these immunological responses can indicate the susceptibility of a population to severe and symptomatic malaria and may be used as an early indicator of risk should malaria be re-introduced into a region. The approach may also be expanded into serosurveillance for vaccine-preventable diseases and other common infectious diseases.
Project Methodology
Importantly it utilises samples from all patients  tested for malaria infection (i.e. malaria negative as well as malaria positive) so that serological outcomes can also be assessed for people with subpatent infections. From 2016, the technical methods for indirect ELISA for malaria antigens will be transferred to the NIMPE laboratory staff. Serosurveillance data will be integrated into the SDSS to identify associations between serological dynamics and disease transmission. The SOPs will be defined in collaboration with Burnet Institute at the start of the implementation period.
Samples will be stored at 4oC at the Provincial level, until transferred to NIMPE. At NIMPE, these DBS will be stored at -20oC until required for batch testing. At that time DBS will be extracted using procedures that will be defined SOPs, and then tested by indirect ELISA, again using defined SOPs. Samples will be identified by a unique barcode.
DBS samples will be used to elute antibodies at the laboratories in NIMPE. These antibodies will then be used to detect reactivity against a range of malaria antigens. This will include antigens that are highly immunogenic and are known to be induced after few infections, and antigens that are less immunogenic and that require multiple exposures to malaria infection. They will also include antigens that are known to induce long-lived antibody responses and therefore reflect exposure over prolonged periods of time and antigens that have short lasting responses and therefore reflect recent exposure to malaria infection. Antigens will be selected from the following: pre-erythrocytic antigens including CSP, merozoite surface proteins including MSP1, MSP2, MSP3, EBA175, EBA140, and Rh proteins.

This activity will serve as the basis for implementation of the project and will guide further activities.
In Vietnam, household level mapping of hotspots will be conducted in Binh Phuoc and Dak Nong provinces to facilitate subsequent enhanced surveillance and targeted interventions. This will be achieved through spatial data collection and enumeration using handheld GPS-enable devices and customised GIS applications.
To support enhanced geospatial surveillance and targeted interventions, a baseline GIS will be built and standardised for the designated areas. Relevant topographic, infrastructure and administrative geospatial data layers (e.g., coastline, elevation, waterways, road networks, administrative boundaries, satellite / aerial imagery etc.) will be collected via available mechanisms, including freely available spatial datasets as well as national and local level data sources. Once collected, these data will be reviewed, cleaned and consolidated. Relevant administrative boundaries will also be acquired so that associated data (epidemiological data and individual cases) can be geo-referenced to their associated geographic location. Once relevant data are geo-referenced, information can be located within a customised GIS so that spatial transmission patterns can be visualised and assessed to support relevant decision-making, including the targeting of priority intervention areas.
Following the geospatial exercise for each target village and the establishing of the foundation GIS database structure, VHWs and commune nurses will be trained in the inputting of case data in real-time into the GIS database system using system compliant smart phones. VHWs will be tasked with inputting both cases they themselves test and treat, as well as cases treated at public/local health facilities. Once cases are identified, the VHW will go to the house of the patient and input the GIS and case information. This then allows for a comprehensive view of case occurrence and clustering within the target villages, permitting early detection of outbreaks and targeted responses.
In consultation with country partners, standardised procedures will be developed, including the implementation of rapid geographical reconnaissance (GR) household mapping to rapidly locate and enumerate target households and support the implementation of planned interventions. Novel field-based survey and remote-area spatial data collection activities will also be conducted in target sites as a means to identify and characterise high-risk population groups such as forest goers and other mobile groups. Rapid malaria case reports will be developed and harmonised with existing routine malaria information system operations.
In target areas, retrospective malaria data will be geo-referenced within the customised GIS at the most detailed resolution possible (at least the village level). Rapidly reported prospective case data will be also incorporated into the customised GIS and mapped to place of residence using the enumerated household GR data, as well as other suspected transmission locations (e.g. forest, forest fringe farms) where relevant. These data will be used to automatically classify and map active transmission foci and support the targeting of appropriate interventions. Population data collected in field surveys will also be used to target non-geographic interventions including Behaviour Change Communication (BCC), community engagement for high risk groups and standby treatments / chemoprophylaxis for forest-goers.
As transmission foci and population specific activities / interventions are implemented, all operations will be monitored within the customised GIS, utilising the detailed geospatial household baseline. Intervention coverage will be automatically mapped and summarised, with areas of poor service delivery highlighted for follow-up.
","The key goal of this activity is to develop and pilot a customised SDSS framework and associated geo-spatial approaches to support enhanced malaria surveillance in Vietnam. It is anticipated that the development and integration of these geospatial surveillance approaches as part of routine malaria surveillance activities in Vietnam will provide malaria program personnel with an effective and easy-to-use operational tool to detect, locate and classify pockets of malaria transmission; to accurately target appropriate foci-specific interventions in required locations; and to manage the implementation of these interventions to ensure that optimal coverage is achieved.
1. Undertake the collection of baseline spatial GIS data that is relevant to identifying the specific location of cases and environmental features relevant to malaria control.
2. Integrate these data to form a Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS).
3. Establish a system of real-time routine data collection of malaria cases from Village Health Workers (VHWs) using mobile phone uploads.
4. Use the SDSS to generate live reporting to NIMPE to inform strategic targeted actions for the control of transmission foci and for malaria elimination.",Geospatial Analysis,"Foci, Measurement of transmission, Surveillance"

2. To identify cost effective, complementary interventions that would drive malaria transmission towards zero. We will achieve this using a trans-disciplinary approach, including entomology, epidemiology, mathematical modelling and economics, to address the following specific research questions:
What are the risk factors associated with malaria infection in children in a rural district of Burkina Faso?
How do physiologically and behaviourally resistant mosquito populations limit LLIN performance?
What are the patterns and determinants of LLIN use and access to treatment?

Due to extensive geographical overlap of HIV and malaria, the two most serious health problems in the world, co-infections are common in nature. These co-infections may increase the emergence and spread of malaria drug resistance, as a result of intervention strategies and weaker immune systems. However, evidence for this is lacking and discussion is speculative of nature. Using an evolutionary framework, I aim to unravel (1) the link between HIV infection and frequency of malaria drug resistance and (2) the selective forces that drive this resistance to higher levels in HIV co-infected individuals.
I will start with a meta-analysis of published studies to determine whether a correlation between prevalence of resistance and prevalence of HIV infection can be seen. In addition, using clinical samples of HIV-positive and HIV-negative pregnant women from five different countries in Sub-Saharan Africa who are currently enrolled in a clinical trial with the aim to test the efficacy of Intermittent Preventative Therapy, I will (i) assess the frequency of resistance markers by direct sequencing, (ii) study the multiplicity of malaria infection using genetic barcoding and (iii) determine the densities of the transmission stages using stage-specific qPCR. I will evaluate these metrics at the start of the intervention, at time of delivery and, from a subset of women in an ancillary study, during the course of pregnancy.
This fellowship merges my expertise in evolutionary biology of infectious diseases with the host?s expertise in clinical malaria in pregnant women. This project has the potential to have a big impact on public health policy, increase our understanding of malaria parasite dynamics in as-of-yet much understudied pregnant women, and contribute critically to malaria eradication.""",Product development & clinical research,Drug resistance

Such knowledge is currently lacking in most arthropod vector species, and this project proposes to tackle this issue by investigating female mating behavior in the African malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae.
It is known that males form swarms in which females come to find a mate but the way females are attracted to swarms is unknown. Through a multidisciplinary approach, stimuli used by females to track and recognize male swarms at long range will be identified. Chemical, visual and acoustic signaling will be investigated.
Results will help improve vector population suppression/replacement strategies and may prompt the development of new bio-inspired traps for vector surveillance and control.

Regarding MOA, most of the hit series that will be investigated by Eisai and MMV have shown to have a chemotype different from current available or known antimalarials, and one of the hit series is shown to have a new MOA that inhibits GPI biosynthesis. Furthermore, hit compounds will first be screened to see if their MOA is the same as existing antimalarial drugs, allowing us to prioritize novel MOAs. Multi-stage activities mean to act on parasites in different life stages.
In the previous Screening Platform, hit series which showed antimalarial activities in two or more life stages of parasites were selected and brought to this project. Inhibition of GPI-biosynthesis is also expected to lead to antimalarial activities against multiple parasite life stages, because many kinds of stage-specific GPI-anchored proteins are expressed in each life stage of the malaria parasite.
 
The additional advantage of targeting GPI biosynthesis is a novel MOA with an identified target protein. The target protein named as Gwt1p, an acyltransferase essential in GPI-biosynthesis, was discovered in Eisai. This MOA was also evaluated for other pathogenic microorganisms and a candidate compound for clinical trials was identified in the previous antifungal project of Eisai.

This includes the young (ring stage) form of the parasite, which is resistant to most other chemotherapeutic agents.
Moreover we found that inhibitors of the proteasome strongly synergize artemisinin-mediated killing of P. falciparum in cultures of both sensitive and resistant strains. Importantly, efficacy of the combination was also observed against P. berghei in a mouse model of malaria in vivo. This indicates that a suitable proteasome inhibitor (i.e. with P. falciparum-specific activity) would be a promising lead in its own right and, would be particularly effective in combinations with artemisinins.

As a consequence, if only people with blood-stage infections are treated, a substantial part of the parasite reservoir will be missed and these medical interventions will not be efficient. Typical P. vivax strains found in tropical settings cause a primary infection followed by a primary relapse. A diagnostic test that detects exposure to P. vivax infections that can identify most, if not all, individuals who potentially harbor hypnozoites is crucial. In order to develop such a test, a well-validated panel of carefully selected, highly immunogenic antigens is required.
The validation will be done in cohort studies in 4 different populations and evaluates the performance of each antigen individual and in combination for the prediction of exposure.

Molecular markers can be used to follow the prevalence of most resistant mutants in the parasite population during malaria elimination activities. Such a molecular surveillance will allow assessing how the parasite population responds to mass drug administration and evaluating elimination approaches based on real-time genotypic susceptibility profiles of the parasite populations.
The aim of this study is to assess the impact of mass drug administration with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ) in Magude district (Mozambican Alliance Towards Elimination of Malaria: MALTEM).

Parasite factors have been suggested to contribute to the development of asymptomatic infection, based on differences noted between different parasite strains and isolates in their pyrogenic thresholds, maximum parasitemia and replication rates. Parasite characteristics that are shaped by host immunity, such as antigen repertoire exposed to the immune system, as well as factors involved in the virulence of malaria infection and malaria proliferation, have the potential to inform about the risk of asymptomatic malaria in a given area.
The overall aim of this study is develop a rapid tool to determine parasite factors that are associated with the risk of asymptomatic malaria in the context of elimination activities in South Mozambique (Mozambican Alliance Towards Elimination of Malaria: MALTEM).

The framework can be adapted to multiple population, Public Health outcomes/ diseases, and can be used to explore policy relevant questions including: what is the likely impact on malaria of a) current climate and b) alternative climatic futures in East Africa derived from and current quality assured observations of climate variability and plausible predictions of future climate based on climate change models.

Objective 1. in collaboration with National Meteorological Agencies (such as the Ethiopia NMA) improve the availability, access and uses of quality assured relevant climate data and undertake analysis at the national and subnational level.
Objective 2. Building on prior research develop and test a climate driven malaria transmission Modeling framework (which incorporates demographic, socio-economic and control factors) for East Africa that accounts for Uncertainty in model initial conditions and parameterization and make this framework freely available to Researchers in affected countries.

Emerging population genetic data have revealed that the Malaria Transmission system is remarkably complex necessitating a much deeper molecular sampling of parasite populations and the development of computational approaches that extend previous 'strain theory' through the lens of var genetics.
This project aims to define the population structure of P. falciparum in the context of var gene diversity and explore epidemiological dynamics in this framework. A team project has been created that brings together mathematical modelers, epidemiologists, entomologists, bioinformaticians, population geneticists and Malaria epidemiologists from Ghana and US.
Our approach combines both modeling and empirical studies to explore Malaria Transmission dynamics of P. falciparum at the level of local parasite populations in northern Ghana in the context of var genetics.

An individual-based, stochastic modeling framework that couples within and between-host Transmission and describes the individual-host immunological History of exposure to different var gene repertoires to explore strain dynamics of P. falciparum in relation to age, seasonality and vector Intervention.

Implementation Science to optimize malaria vector control and disease management,http://www.malariaeradication.org/mesa-track/implementation-science-optimize-malaria-vector-control-and-disease-management,Project,Jul-10,Jun-15,"Tanzania, United Republic of",$406 188,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,Duke University,Randall A. Kramer,,"Malaria is one of the greatest health challenges facing the developing world. World Health Organization data indicate that malaria causes over 1 million deaths per year, with over 90% of those deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa. A number of strategies are available to prevent malaria, including the use of insecticide treated nets and indoor residual spraying for vector control and a variety of diagnostic strategies and drug therapies for both prophylaxis and treatment. However, it is often difficult for decision-makers to determine the best combination of interventions, given the constraints within local health care delivery systems, as well as in vector control infrastructure. Thus, the central objective of this proposal is to improve malaria control outcomes through an implementation science approach that integrates health delivery experiments and decision support modeling to promote joint optimization of vector control and disease management strategies. We propose three specific aims: (1) perform randomized experiments of vector control and disease management strategies in Tanzania to elucidate which intervention strategy combinations are most effective in real world settings, using an implementation science approach; (2) use analytical insights from the health delivery experiments to refine an existing decision support model that includes both vector control and disease management; and (3) develop approaches for replicating the decision support tool in other parts of Tanzania and other countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Accomplishing these combined specific aims will provide a framework for designing and implementing multi-pronged malaria control strategies that have the best chances for sustained effectiveness in an operational setting. We will test the effectiveness of different combinations of vector and disease management interventions over time based on field experiments. We will then use the experimental results in conjunction with decision support modeling to improve a new tool that will allow decision-makers to jointly optimize vector and disease management strategies. The tool is flexible enough to incorporate new therapies and interventions as they are developed. This proposal has been developed in a collaborative process with critical partners in Tanzania and, thus, leverages an active and vibrant set of professional relationships. Through these in-country partnerships, we have direct access to key decision-makers at both the local and national levels. In addition, our previous work across Africa provides a strong platform from which to launch future replication in areas beyond the primary study site

That requires adaptations in health systems and policies but it is not clear how. 
We hypothesize that participation and investment of the population beyond the vertically organised national malaria control program (PNLP) is the way to go forward. 
We will apply organizational change management systems and facilitating techniques proven within the field of organizational change and community building that (1) connect knowledge and ownership in the local community to the national and district malaria control program and that (2) will lead to design of health systems interventions towards malaria elimination. This process of expeditionary action and learning will be implemented with repeated participatory works. 
Annual household surveys into malaria, entomology, sociology, economy and indicators of ownership and willingness to invest will be conducted as well as a continuous monitoring of health service coverage and preventive measures. The process of intervention design and the interventions and their impact itself are topics of study for 4 PhD students.
The community will be able to organise itself, start identifying weaknesses in local malaria control and start connecting to primary district and national health services to develop / adapt in interventions with available technologies that are appropriate and are financially sustainable. The required technology for facilitating groups processes will be transferred by experts from the 100th Village. One of the techniques is the open space which was already successfully tested during the grant writing workshop. 
PhD project 1 facilitates the entire program, looks at group dynamics, self organisation, ownership and commitment and follows intervention design and implementation. 
PhD project 2 studies public health, health service coverage and the health management information system (HMIS), generates the malariometric data that steer intervention design. 
PhD project 3 focuses on Integrated vector management (IVM) and the integration in the context of the health systems. The farmer field school is an example of an intervention that has proved to fruitful. A driving force of social mobilization for disease control is a clear return on investment for the population. This return can be materially, but also spiritually.

This greatly hinders efforts to measure progress or target interventions against these residual vectors, a substantial proportion of which also readily bite humans outdoors and can survive on non-human host blood [15, 18, 21-23].
The goal of this project is an effective strategy for monitoring densities and transmission activity of these residual malaria vector populations, which will improve targeting of interventions towards elimination. The recent successes in developing odour-baited mosquito control technologies [24-29] will be extended to calibrate and select simple trapping techniques that are representative of humans, and adaptable for large-scale mosquito sampling without requiring human volunteers.
The traps will be deployed using ecologically motivated sampling schemes to maximise catches even where the mosquito species occur in very low densities. The natural behaviour of these residual vectors will also be examined using innovative field experiments.
Finally, cutting-age quantitative ecology approaches, developed for analysing wild species distributions and trophic interactions, will be used to create predictive models for multi-scale targeting of mosquito densities and transmission activity, based on observable biotic and abiotic environmental variables.

A simple genetic marker that quickly and accurately identifies the geographic origin of infections would be a valuable tool for locating the source of outbreaks, and spotting the spread of drug resistant parasites from Asia into Africa. Genetic markers have proved extremely valuable in tracking and eradicating diseases, such as Polio. However, the previous candidates for malaria genetic barcodes have relied on identifying DNA markers found in the parasite nucleus, which shows too much genetic variation between individual parasites to be used accurately. Now, DNA sequences found outside the nucleus in organelles called the mitochondria and the apicoplast have been analysed. These are only inherited through maternal lines and therefore much more stable over generations than nuclear DNA sequences. The research outlined in this methodology proposal will create computational tools which will help to exploit use of mitochondria and the apicoplast sequences to create reliable genetic barcodes for tracking the geographical movement of malaria in an operational context. 
We will create a publically available online resource to facilitate the widespread use of barcoding. It will be of practical use to malaria control agencies and research groups worldwide.

Development of new analytical approaches which can discriminate the different species even in mixed infections by creating a statistical algorithm to infer informative SNP haplotypes within and between species from complex mixed infections. The perfect linkage disequilibrium or ""perfect phylogeny"" across the co-inherited organelle SNPs leads to an opportunity to construct phylogenetic trees that represent the relationship between haplotypes. Crucially this allows modelling approaches to disaggregate complex mixed infections.
To refine the existing barcoding methodology for discriminating between infections originating from geographically distinct populations of the same species.

The challenges have to do with Plasmodium vivax. Islands provide natural ecological experiments and a great potential for intervention studies. On Aneityum island, Vanuatu both P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria were eliminated with short-term mass drug administration (MDA) in 1991 and sustained case surveillance and vector control with a high degree of community participation.
I intend to
i.) assess whether malaria freedom can be sustained and ii) examine the applicability of the proposed elimination strategy at the natural endemic margin to larger areas.
For its evaluation annual malariometric surveys of the entire population on Aneityum will be continued in comparison with six Vanuatu islands with variable malaria transmission.I specifically aim to:
1. Investigate resurgence and relate them to anti-malaria immune responses and parasite antigen diversities
2. Examine the strategy of radical MDA in concert with vector control to eliminate P. vivax infections in selected islands,
3. Assess feasibility of sustainable community commitment after malaria elimination and impacts of malaria elimination on people´s gains, tourism and community development.
The outcomes can serve as a model for the proposal of community-directed strategies towards sustainable malaria freedom to follow the short-term push by external donors, particularly for the areas where P. vivax can be a concern

The proposed research strategy follows the objectives outlined in the FOA and involves 4 themes:
a) Operational research (OR) related to malaria transmission reduction,
b) OR to identify novel or improved interventions for children with severe malarial anaemia and pregnant women,
c) Maximising the public health impact by supporting translation of global policies for the control of malaria in pregnancy to country level policies through information exchange (3.1), and
d) Strengthening research capacity of the overseas partners in Kenya, Malawi and Indonesia by provision of individual level PhD and post-doctoral studentships and group courses.
Malaria transmission reduction OR activities take place under the umbrella of the long-term collaboration between the Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) and CDC in Kenya. LSTM will work with CDC to provide technical support to KEMRI to build the information infrastructure needed to track malaria transmission intensity and progress towards malaria control targets, including the rational development of large-scale entomological monitoring systems in situations with declining vector densities, increased outdoor biting and vector resistance to the commonly used insecticides (1.1), support the development of enhanced semi-automated routine surveillance systems with scannable registers, and conduct continuous malaria indicator surveys for real- time monitoring of the case-burden and infection prevalence (4.1).
LSTM will support CDC to develop the concept and seek funding for proof-of-principle studies that determine the safety, feasibility and effectiveness of mass-drug administration with antimalarials when combined with indoor residual spraying (2.1). It will support dose finding studies with primaquine and ivermectin that aim to identify adjunct therapies to enhance the impact of mass drug administration (MDA) (2.2), and support the economic evaluation of different interventions and surveillance methods as part of the transmission reduction activities (2.3).
Studies in high risk groups includes research to improve adherence to malaria case-management guidelines in pregnancy in western Kenya (1.2) and three large multi-centre trials including one on the prevention of rebound admissions and deaths with post-discharge malaria chemoprevention in children with severe anaemia in Kenya (2.4) and two on the control of malaria in pregnancy: STOPMiP-Indonesia (2.6), STOPMIP2 in Kenya and Malawi (2.5) evaluating the safety and efficacy of intermittent preventive therapy with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine

Mathanga,National Malaria Control Programme (NMCP) Malawi,"Morbidity and mortality from malaria remains unacceptably high in Malawi, despite the scale up of various malaria control interventions. This high burden could be as a result of problems in 1) program implementation, 2) uptake and utilization of interventions, 3) absence of a proper program monitoring and evaluation and possibly 4) lack of relevant research to support the program.
The Malaria Alert Centre is applying on behalf of the College of Medicine;University of Malawi to undertake a cooperative agreement with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA to support the Malawi Ministry of Health's efforts to reduce malaria related morbidity and mortality. This cooperative agreement proposal has six main objectives.
Objective 1 consists of the conduct of malaria operational research and monitoring and evaluation activities in Malawi. The Ministry of Health has identified collection of entomological indicators as one of the key monitoring and evaluation activities featured highly in this proposal.
Objective 2 will develop and validate the impact of revised, enhanced or novel Interventions that will contribute to effective malaria control in Malawi. Since there is a lot of co-morbidities in Malawi,
Objective 3 will assess strategies to reduce the burden of other infectious diseases.
Objective 4 consists of supporting the Ministry of Health in translating the many operational research findings into policy whilst objective 4 and 5 will improve malaria surveillance systems and build capacity for these in the ministry.
In order to achieve these, a number of field and laboratory studies have been suggested. The center will also establish a knowledge hub to facilitate communication between researchers and policy makers to support the translation of knowledge into policy. A number of monitoring and evaluation activities have also been proposed, including efforts to build capacity to evaluate the program. Most of the proposed activities are unique and relevant to the national and global malaria control agenda.
The activities will be conducted in collaboration with the National Malaria Control Program, with technical support from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (USA) and other centers of excellence. This cooperation will build reasonable local capacity to undertake future malaria research on behalf of the Ministry of Health. Data and lessons learnt will be shared with the Ministry of Health, President Malaria Initiative (PMI), USAID and other malaria implementing partners for wider dissemination, to promote the implementation of evidence based malaria interventions

Our philosophy for training is to emphasize research, with trainees participating in both hands-on mentored malaria research and formal training programs designed to complement the hands on-training and facilitate growth of trainees into independent researchers.
We believe that our program has been highly successful, as evidenced by the accomplishments of our trainees. About 50 Ugandan junior scientists have received advanced training, mostly at the Masters level, 13 of these trainees have so far advanced to PhD training, and our more senior trainees are advancing to academic positions in Uganda. Our trainees have authored ~250 papers during or after their training, with 61 first-author papers to date. We are gratified by the successes of our trainees.
However, the need for training in malaria research in Uganda remains great. Thus, we feel that it is appropriate to continue our program, building upon our initial success and upon the structures for training that we have established. With maturation of our malaria research program in Uganda and an increased supply of highly qualified training applicants, we plan some changes to our program, in particular increased emphasis on higher level training. We now plan 5 training tracks: 1) short-term training outside Uganda; 2) Masters training at Makerere University; 3) advanced Masters training at UCSF; 4) sandwich PhD training at Makerere University; and 5) postdoctoral training.
We are excited about our success to date with both training and research on malaria in Uganda, and we anticipate that continued funding will allow continued progress toward the establishment of cutting-edge independent research capacity in this country and also toward the control and elimination of malaria.

Development of recycle-based homemade sugar baits against Anopheles arabiensis ,http://www.grandchallenges.ca/grantee-stars/0555-01-10/,Project,Mar-14,Dec-15,"Tanzania, United Republic of",$90 005,Grand Challenges Canada,"Stars in Global Health-Round 6. 100,000 CAD",,Ifakara Health Institute (IHI),Marta Maia,,"Ivermectin was chosen as the mosquitocidal ingredient, because of its high safety profile and also because it is easily available in remote locations in East Africa. Several lure designs were tested, using plastic bottles and containers of different shapes and sizes, different cloth colours and different fruit concoctions, as well as different ways of providing a wet sugar surface for the mosquitoes to feed on.
Most mosquitoes preferred to feed on plain 10% sugar solution rather than on fruit juices, and the best prototype design consisted of a bucket with a piece of old mattress soaked in sugar solution containing ivermectin and lined with black cloth in its inner surface.
This design attracted a significantly high number of mosquitoes, as they like to rest in dark and humid places. A community-based social study was conducted to collect data on general health behaviours and knowledge of malaria:  prevention, treatment and socio-economic impacts. The project developed an effective toxic mosquito lure for less than $0.10 US/unit. These lures were tested in a semi-field system (hut) with volunteers for 16 nights, to determine their best location.
Outcome: Results show that 50% of the recaptured mosquitoes had taken a sugar meal from a lure and that 33% had sought a sugar meal outdoors before entering a hut in search of a human blood meal. It was concluded that the malaria vectors were choosing to take a sugar meal before seeking a blood meal. This may be a method for the mosquito to obtain a small amount of energy needed for the host-seeking process. The fact that most mosquitoes only took half a sugar meal suggests that they preferred not to engorge on sugar solution, in order to still have enough ?space? for a blood meal. This has not yet been described in the literature and the team intends to publish these results.
The research team intends to apply for Transition To Scale Phase II, funding to improve the sugar lures to accommodate the suggestions provided by the community. The next steps would be to optimize the lures and further validate the prototype in a clinical trial. The team anticipates scaling up the intervention and conducting a cluster randomized controlled trial in two ecologically different field sites ? a sugar-poor environment and a sugar-rich environment ? to investigate whether the innovation in association with treated nets can reduce malaria prevalence.

In the last decade, improved access to healthcare, anti-malarial drugs, insecticide treated bed net (ITN) programs; indoor residual spraying (IRS) programs have greatly reduced the burden of malaria in Africa.  However, malaria is still one of the leading causes of death in young African children.  Therefore, Genesis Laboratories, in collaboration with researchers at the Kenyan Medical Research Institute, has embarked on a project to develop new products to reduce malaria transmission in Africa.  These products target vectors that infrequently, come in contact with current malaria vector control methods. These products have the potential to be effective tools that the malaria eradication programs throughout Africa can use to reduce disease transmission caused by malaria vectors with behaviours that make them difficult to target with conventional technologies.
","The long-term goal of the research is to create a product that can be utilized in an integrated malaria management programme, particularly to augment current control methodologies aimed at endophilic vectors by targeting more exophilic vectors with broader host utilization, such as An. arabiensis.
To that end, this study examined the efficacy of ivermectin, eprinomectin and fipronil on the survivorship of adult An. arabiensis.

 The hit compounds were first confirmed as being active selectively against Plasmodium by obtaining concentration-response data against parasites and mammalian cells.  The most interesting frontrunners were then resynthesized and fully tested to ensure the compounds met the stringent GHIT Hit to Lead Platform criteria.  
The proposal focuses on three confirmed hit series, though given the likely attrition, particularly in the early stages, there are additional options for chemistry should any series fail quickly.  The objectives for the project are to transform these hits into Lead series with proven in vivo efficacy so as to build a strong Lead Optimisation project for the future, and ultimately deliver a preclinical candidate for malaria.  The chemistry for the project will be lead out of Daiichi-Sankyo India in New Delhi, and the team will consist of scientific experts from Daiichi-Sankyo, Japan and MMV as well as parasitology and DMPK experts from within the MMV network.

Through international collaboration between Hokkaido University, Kitasato University and Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV), we are developing concise and versatile synthetic process to produce a series of aza-ARTs having desired pharmacological properties, with the intention of generating novel lead compounds against the emerging ART-resistant strains.
As a notable feature of the drug design, the small change on atomic level, replacing a single carbon of the ART skeleton with a nitrogen, opens a new vista for achieving major improvements in production efficiency as well as requisite water solubility. Exploiting versatile reactivity of the nitrogen functional group, we have gained expeditious access to the aza-ARTs through single-step assembly of three building blocks and subsequent manipulations to construct the complex skeleton in a small number of steps.
Our approach is expected to drastically simplify de novo chemical synthesis of ART derivatives without modifications of the trioxane core, the key substructure responsible for the potent anti-malarial activity.

Compounds in this series show excellent efficacy in mouse models of malaria.
We believe that further development of the current leads, in partnership with Eisai and the GHIT Fund, could yield a clinical candidate with a much-desired therapeutic profile including rapid parasite clearance, activity against drug-resistant strains, and prophylactic and transmission-blocking activity. The goal of this proposal is to further optimize these compounds to yield a preclinical candidate that meets one of the target product profiles defined by MMV.
The compounds we hope to develop into new malaria therapeutics are novel in two respects:
First, the compounds are derived from a unique chemical process termed Diversity-oriented synthesis, which allows us to synthesize complex molecules that have many of the advantages of natural products (e.g. structural diversity) but are also easily modified and optimized in the laboratory. The Broad?s compound library comprises 100,000 such compounds that are not available anywhere else.
Secondly, our compounds appear to be inhibiting a component of protein synthesis that is not targeted by any other malaria therapeutics. This novel mechanism-of-action will be useful in the clinic to inhibit malaria parasites that are resistant to all other malaria therapies, including chloroquine and pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine.

- Study the co-administration DSM265 and OZ439 in healthy volunteer to evaluate any potential drug-drug interaction;
- Study the anti-malarial activity of the combination of DSM265 and OZ439, with endpoints of time to parasite clearance, PRR and time to relapse;
- Study the transmission blocking activity of the combination by standard membrane feeding assay (SMFA) to anopheles with oocyte development as the endpoint;
- Provide information to estimate the optimal doses for future development of a DSM265 and OZ439 combination antimalarial.
OZ439 is currently being developed by MMV in phase II, and fulfils the criteria of MMV?s Target Candidate Profile 1 - TCP1 (fast parasite clearance). DSM265 is in phase Ib, with available information from studies that we have run to date indicating that it fits Target Candidate Profile 2 - TCP2 (long acting). Antimalarial activity and exposure in the patients suggest that a combination of both drugs could provide a single dose antimalarial therapy, thus allowing a single, directly observed administration to patients thereby improving compliance and convenience.
In this project we propose to study this combination in a single trial, conducted at QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Queensland Australia.
Part I: Eight healthy human volunteers will receive a single dose of DSM265 and OZ439 to confirm that no significant drug-drug interactions are occurring. 
Part II: P. falciparum blood stage challenge. Each of eight participants in the cohort will be inoculated on Day 0 with ~1,800 viable Plasmodium falciparum-infected human erythrocytes (BSPC) administered intravenously.
Following treatment with DSM265/OZ439, subjects will be followed up as in-patients for at least 48 hours, to ensure tolerance of the treatment and clinical response, then if clinically well on an outpatient basis for safety and continued presence of malaria parasites via PCR. The effects of DSM265/OZ439 on parasitemia are expected to be observed for up to sixteen days.

Screening of a large diversity library revealed the dihydroisoquinolones (DHIQ?s), as a chemically novel class of antimalarials targeting PfATP4.  A clinical candidate has emerged from these studies, (+)-SJ000557733, (+)-SJ733 for short, that meets or exceeds all of the requirements for a SERCaP fast acting component.
The (+)-SJ733 project aligns with the MMV Target Product and Candidate Profiles that were established in 2013 to better define the needs of the eradication agenda.  As such, (+)-SJ733 fulfills the criteria for a rapid acting antimalarial (TCP1) for use in a combination therapy for treatment (TPP1). The compound acts via PfATP4, a clinically validated pathway based on the data from Novartis? KAE609. Furthermore, the clinical rate of parasite clearance for this mechanism is extremely rapid, so assuming (+)-SJ733 works in a similar way then the principle efficacy requirements are significantly de-risked.  (+)-SJ733 is a remarkably ?clean? compound with safety margins projected to be between better than 40-fold, coupled with the fact that the dose limiting toxicity is still relatively innocuous. 
 Thus (+)-SJ733 offers not only a high likelihood of excellent efficacy but also good tolerability and lack of drug-drug interactions ? a quality that is particularly important given the targeted patient population, the state of the health care systems in endemic regions and the times of co-morbidities (and resultant drug regimens) that patients are often on.  The risk with (+)-SJ733 pertains to the human pharmacokinetics.  If in the expected range, a single dose treatment is likely; at worst, an acceptable 3 day treatment will be targeted.  Thus (+)-SJ733 will be positioned to either replace artemisinin, which is particularly relevant given observed decreased parasite clearance times with ART in SE Asia or, at best, to be a new fast acting component in a single dose combination treatment.

Existing TBV candidates and formulations have not been optimized for expression, scalability, or the induction of high-titer functional antibodies in humans. As a result, the transmission-blocking pipeline is small and immature. The identification and rigorous testing of novel antigens is needed to expand the diversity of approaches under development.
The PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI) has partnered with Ehime University to accelerate the development of a novel (Pf75) vaccine candidate. This project will need to meet predefined development stage-gates to determine whether Pf75 is a suitable candidate that meets the requirement for function (blocking parasite development in standard membrane feeding assays [SMFAs]), manufacture through identification of scalable expression systems, and suitability of process development and adjuvant formulation. 
This proposal aims at fast-tracking Pf75, which targets a different mode of action from the present TBV candidates, such as Pfs25, once proof of principle is demonstrated and stage-gate requirements are met. MVI will streamline development efforts in manufacture through identification of scalable expression systems; assess the functionality of the Pf75 novel TBV candidate through qualified SMFA, and suitability of process development and adjuvant formulation; and examine ways to evaluate combinations with existing target antigens, such as Pfs25, resulting in acting alone or synergistic enhancement of transmission-blocking activity. These activities will add value and benefits to the existing small and immature pipeline of TBVs.

Hence, in addition to its potential for long duration of coverage (ideal profile for chemoprotection), and it has a reduced resistance risk. ELQ300 could also have potential for single-dose treatment of malaria in combination with a fast-acting partner. 
ELQ300 entered preclinical development in Q3 2012. The principal risks are associated with its very low solubility in aqueous and biorelevant media, which has hampered absorption in high doses in vivo DMPK (Distribution Metabolism and PharmacoKinetics) experiments and achievement of adequate levels of exposure to demonstrate therapeutic margins. The proposed partnership will enable extensive formulation work which, coupled with a standard preclinical development package, should allow establishment of a safety margin and progression into man.
Specifically, the areas to still be explored include lipid-based formulations, co-solvents, and amorphous dispersions. Frontrunner formulations would then be tested in rodents and dogs to confirm increased exposure of drug necessary for safety studies and further development
.Whilst this partnership is focused on a single workstream, the reformulation of the compound, it could be expanded in the future to include subsequent steps (i.e. GLP safety studies etc.), and could potentially form the basis for a longer-term partnership for the development and commercialization of ELQ-300 within a Japanese regulatory context.

The overall project goal is to develop this compound to become an alternative to the 4 aminoquinolines or aminoalcohols that are currently part of artemisinin combination therapies. These historical partner drugs are at risk due to resistance or have a suboptimal safety profile, and DSM265 is one of the few existing molecules in humans that has a realistic chance of being a credible replacement.
Medicines for Malaria Venture and Takeda Pharmaceuticals propose to collaborate to progress the molecule through to a Proof of Concept study (Phase IIa) in patients, in addition to a prophylaxis Proof of Concept study (Phase Ib) in healthy volunteers bitten by malaria infected mosquitoes. Potentially, PoC in both sub-indications be reached in 2014.
Whilst this partnership is principally focused on clinical studies to be led by MMV it could potentially form the basis for a longer-term partnership for the development and ultimately commercialization of DSM265 within a Japanese regulatory context

Accelerating Development of Vaccines for Malaria Elimination Using a Novel Clinical Target Validation Approach,http://www.malariaeradication.org/mesa-track/accelerating-development-vaccines-malaria-elimination-using-novel-clinical-target,Project,2013,,,$591 396,Global Health Innovative Technology (GHIT) Fund ,,"PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI), Ehime University, Japan , CellFree Sciences",,,"PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI), Ehime University, Japan , CellFree Sciences","Highly efficacious vaccines that interrupt malaria transmission (VIMT) are urgently needed to help control malaria and support future elimination and eventual eradication efforts. Pre-erythrocytic (PE) vaccines that prevent mosquito-to-human transmission are highly desirable; they can prevent disease and death, as well as support elimination efforts by preventing infection, thereby breaking the cycle of transmission. Controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) models enable the determination of VIMT-PE vaccine efficacy in small numbers of volunteers.
The PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative, a program of the US-based global nonprofit organization PATH, initiated a tripartite collaboration with Ehime University and CellFree Sciences Co. Ltd. (both based in Japan) for the identification and initial validation of novel PE malaria vaccine candidates. The concept is to generate monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against a panel of PE antigens that are candidate targets of humoral immunity. These mAbs will be evaluated, via passive transfer studies, for their capacity to protect against parasite infection using the well-established CHMI model.
","This new project aims at supporting the evaluation of novel PE vaccine antigens. Evaluation of these antigens using conventional vaccine development approach is not financially feasible and is unlikely to lead to conclusive outcomes regarding target validation due to the high number of variables (e.g., delivery platform selection, adjuvant selection, variable immune responses, etc.).
The plan is to accelerate target validation for malaria vaccine development by employing a novel, translational research approach that uses mAbs?with demonstrated preclinical functional activity?in CHMI studies. This would enable validation of target antigens, and provide a critical reagent (i.e., protective mAb), prior to engaging in vaccine development efforts.","Enabling technologies & assays, Product development & clinical research",Immune correlates of protection
Clinical Development of BK-SE36/CpG Malaria Vaccine,http://www.malariaeradication.org/mesa-track/clinical-development-bk-se36cpg-malaria-vaccine,Project,2013,,,$714 500,Global Health Innovative Technology (GHIT) Fund ,,"Gulu University, Uganda","Research Institute for Microbial Diseases (RIMD), Osaka University",,"Gulu University, Uganda","Med Biotech Laboratories (MBL) and the Research Institute for Microbial Diseases (RIMD), Osaka University have been working together in malaria research for about a decade. Together, they have recently completed a two-stage (6-40 years-old) GCP compliant clinical trial in Lira, Uganda.  The study results showed acceptable safety and immunogenicity profiles. In the follow-up study 130-365 days post-second vaccination, protective efficacy against malaria episodes with high parasitemia (>5000 parasites/µL) and fever was 72%. This means that BK-SE36 can afford protection against clinical malaria to vaccinated subjects. However, unlike the 100% response/seroconversion observed in malaria naïve Japanese volunteers, serconversion was low in the malaria endemic area, particularly in older age groups.
Believing that stronger adjuvants can either improve immunogenicity or be capable of eliciting longer-lasting vaccine immune response, RIMD did preclinical trials with the formulation BK-SE36/CpG. CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG ODN) are short, single-stranded synthetic DNA molecules that are being tested as vaccine adjuvants. Following successful preclinical studies, a first-in-human clinical trial (Phase Ia) of BK-SE36/CpG in malaria naïve Japanese adults was initiated with the Medical Center for Translational Research, Osaka University Hospital. Seeking to provide the most suitable and effective vaccine formulation, in the late 2010, the collaboration also widened to include Gulu University under the Program for Strategic Promotion of International Cooperation to Accelerate Innovation in Developing Countries.
The present study seeks to select a more ?robust? vaccine formulation. Besides the standard evaluation of safety and immunogenicity in phase 1a clinical trials, we want to evaluate the quality of the induced antibody in volunteers and compare these to Phase Ib volunteers as well as to those who have naturally acquired immunity against malaria.

The first-line treatments in Brazil in infections by P. falciparum uncomplicated are the combinations of artemether-lumefantrine (Coartem) and artesunate-mefloquine (Farmanguinhos). The regimen of second choice is the quinine-doxycycline combination.
A parasite is considered resistant when it is able to survive and multiply in your blood stage asexual, despite the administration and proper absorption of a chemotherapeutic regimen. Today, evidence of decreased efficacy to treatment with artemisinin and its derivatives in P. falciparum isolates from Thailand and Cambodia. 
Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in some genes showed affect parasite response to different antimalarials.  A phenomenon that requires further study is the dormant mechanism in P. falciparum, proposed as a mechanism of tolerance to artemisinin. Under this mechanism, the parasites are able to tolerate the action of artemisinin by blocking the maturation temporarily, similar to what occurs with some bacteria.
The adoption of ACTs as first-line treatment for P. falciparum not serious, necessitates monitoring studies that are sentinels to detect decreased sensitivity of this parasite to artemisinin derivatives and drugs used in association such as mefloquine and lumefantrine. 
This study proposes the in vitro determination of phenotypic profile of P. falciparum response to artesunate and mefloquine, ACT that is used in extra-Brazilian Amazon region, in addition to proposing an unprecedented assessment of the response to lumefantrine, used in combination with artemether in area Brazilian endemic. Also unprecedented is the evaluation of dormancy mechanism isolates of P. falciparum Brazilians to ACTs adopted in the country.

MAEBL is a chimeric molecule expressed on infected erythrocytes and has a portion rich amino terminal cysteine, transmembrane domain, cytoplasmic domain and other two (M1 and M2). Although both domains are involved in parasite binding to erythrocytes M2 domain is essential for merozoite invasion and exhibits higher adhesiveness.
Recently, it was shown that MAEBL is also expressed in the salivary gland sporozoites and infected hepatocytes. In addition, the gene encoding the protein MAEBL (MAEBL) was identified in different species of plasmodia, including P. vivax.

The most aggressive and effective Neotropical vector of malaria parasites, particularly in the Amazon basin, is the Anopheles darlingi. The impact generated by this species is facilitated by its characteristic to explore new environments arising from ecosystem changes via factors associated with deforestation, ie the so-called border malaria outbreak.
There are over 2,700 agricultural settlements in the Brazilian Amazon, and which accounted for 63,000 cases of malaria in Brazil in 2012. The Border Malaria Hypothesis claims that the incidence of malaria has its peak in the early stages of colonization and declines with age of the settlement.
The Border Malaria Hypothesis (HMF) will be tested, making explicit the separation of the old settlement and the effects of landscape fragmentation. It will be employed ecological experimental design in state of the art to compare environmental variables at three levels of fragmentation of the landscape and two types of habitats in new and old settlements in two regions (east and west) of the Amazon in Brazil.
Entomological metrics and malaria transmission dynamics will be compared entre12 settlements, applying mixed-effects regression models. Three mathematical models representing the dynamics of malaria transmission will be used to understand the emergence of malaria in different landscape fragmentation thresholds. The first model is the Ross-Macdonald (H0), the second is the model oriented to biodiversity (H1) and the third is the model of interaction networks (H2).
These models will be calibrated with primary data in the field and the values of their R0 (basal number of reproducibility of the disease) will be compared to epidemiological data provided by the Ministry of Health. Simulations will be conducted with these models what-if scenarios to identify the main mechanisms responsible for the successful transmission of malaria. 
The expected results are that the modified HMF, which takes into account both age and fragmentation may allow greater predictive power to determine An invasion. Darlingi and other vectors that cause the emergence of malaria in a wide variety of types of fragmented landscapes

This hinders control measures, but also means that targeting additional interventions on hotspots will be highly effective. At present, we do not know how best to detect these hotspots, or how to apply the interventions available. For example, we need to know how much transmission in the surrounding area results from the hotspot, and how focal the point source is.
I will analyse 19 years of historical data on malaria from coastal Kenya, supplemented by data from the Gambia in West Africa, to determine the spatial patterns of hotspots and how they might be detected. I will extend my findings by collaborations with investigators collecting spatial data on malaria cases in Gambia, Indonesia and elsewhere in Africa.
In collaboration with Dominic Kwiatkowski in the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, I will conduct detailed genotyping studies to assign a bar-code to malaria parasites. This will allow me to distinguish the recent origin of malaria parasites isolated in the field, in order to inform the design of targeted interventions against hotspots.
Technical SummaryMalaria transmission is spatially heterogeneous, and groups of homesteads that form hotspots or clusters of transmission can be identified. The presence of these hotspots makes malaria control measures less effective than they might be. However, adding targeted interventions to interrupt these hotspots will be highly effective.
At present, we lack detailed epidemiological descriptions of the properties of hotspots and the ways in which they might be identified by malaria control programmes. Furthermore, in order to rationally design targeted interventions, we need to understand their transmission dynamics. For example, we need to know how much transmission in the surrounding area results from the hotspot, and how focal the point source is.
I will analyse 19 years of historical data on severe malaria, mild malaria and asymptomatic infection in Kilifi, Kenya. I will use datasets from cohorts under active surveillance in the field, and passive dispensary and hospital level surveillance, to describe the spatial and temporal limits of individual clusters of transmission, and the epidemiological markers of them. I will obtain external validation of my findings by collaborations with investigators collecting spatial data on malaria cases in Africa, including the Gambia and Indonesia.

This research project will determine which people are infected with Plasmodium gametocytes, evaluate resulting mosquito infections that derive from those infectious people, and infer population-level patterns of malaria risk that emerge from these transmission events.
We will take advantage of ongoing NIH-funded research (International Centers of Excellence for Malaria Research) in southern Malawi where different intensities of transmission occur. Using a new molecular-genetic detection technique (qRT-PCR) for recognizing low-density P. falciparum gametocytes that are not normally seen through microscopy, we will explore associations between infection and symptoms, treatment, age and various environmental/behavioral risk factors.
Specifically, we will test three hypotheses addressing:
 The prevalence of parasitemia, and specifically gametocytemia, in relation to transmission intensity and treatment,
Patterns of gametocytemia with regard to age, mosquito ecology, and anti-malarial interventions, and
Impacts on household-level transmission to Anopheles vectors.
This project is innovative in using a new molecular diagnostic method to evaluate naturally-infected, asymptomatic people combined with non-experimental field transmission to mosquitoes found in common living contexts of the region.

Female Anopheles mosquitoes are the carriers (vectors) for human malaria.
When a mosquito bites an infected individual, it takes up infectious forms of the malaria parasite along with blood. The parasite undergoes a complex journey through its mosquito vector, before it can subsequently be injected into the next human host via mosquito bite. The fact that the parasite must cross two mosquito epithelial barriers and circulate within the hemolymph creates obvious opportunities for the epithelial and humoral immune responses of the mosquito to attack the parasite.
My research aims to understand the regulation of the mosquito's innate immune system and how it relates to the parasites it transmits. Specifically, the research in this project aims to identify novel mosquito factors limiting parasite survival in its mosquito vector. Such knowledge could potentially be used to design novel malaria intervention strategies, in which the parasite transmission cycle in the mosquito would be interrupted by boosting the mosquitoes' natural immunity.

Developing methods to assess the impact of malaria interventions upon transmission and the progress towards elimination,http://www.malariaeradication.org/mesa-track/developing-methods-assess-impact-malaria-interventions-upon-transmission-and-progress,Project,Mar-14,Mar-17,Kenya,$501 327,"Medical Research Council (MRC), UK","£299,834 GBP",,Imperial College London,Patrick George Walker,,"Malaria, an infectious disease transmitted by mosquitoes, is estimated to cause around 1 million deaths per year, with the majority of these deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa, primarily amongst young children. Over the last decade there has been an increase in funding from high-income countries and global agencies with the aim of reducing transmission and hence decreasing the burden of disease. This has resulted in the large-scale distribution of interventions of cheap and effective interventions such as the provision of protective bed nets and antimalarial medication in many parts of the world.
Malaria is, however, a complicated disease. It is spread between humans by mosquitoes and people become more immune to the disease the more they are infected (and less immune when they are not). This makes it difficult to work out the progress that has been made in reducing transmission. For example, a 50% reduction in the number of mosquito bites would not necessarily produce a 50% reduction in the proportion of people with malaria. Moreover, as transmission is imperfect and requires an infected mosquito to survive until it becomes infectious to humans, it is not necessary to kill all mosquitoes or prevent all members of the population from being bitten to achieve elimination. 
In Western Kenya, particularly around the shores of Lake Victoria, malaria transmission remains intense, even in areas where bed nets have been used by the majority of the population for over a decade and despite the availability of effective anti-malarial medication for those with the disease. As a result, further intervention measures are currently being considered, including a forthcoming trial looking at the effects of testing all residents within a village for infection and giving highly effective anti-malarial medication to all those who test positive to infection in an attempt to break transmission. In order to better understand the progress towards this goal, and the implication the trial outcome has for malaria elimination more generally, it is important to understand where the trial started and where the trial ended in terms of transmission (i.e. the chances of an infected person passing infection to others via a mosquito), as this is the only reliable measure of the extent to which elimination is likely to be sustainable.
In this project, Dr Patrick Walker, a researcher at the Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, Imperial College, will use mathematical models of the spread of malaria to estimate the changes in transmission that occur during this trial to assess the progress being made towards local elimination of the disease. This will first involve developing a statistical technique which is able to estimate changes in transmission intensity during a previous trial of protective nets in the same area This work will also allow him to investigate the extent to which the disease spreads from one village to another and how this is affected by the presence of nets within different areas. This technique will then be adapted and applied to the different arms of the drug trial, taking into account changes in transmission up to the beginning of the trial.
In the event that the mass administration of anti-malarials proves effective as a tool for helping Western Kenya to eliminate malaria, this research will help to further define the criteria by which to judge where else in the world the intervention could be effective. Alternatively, if the intervention does not prove effective the work will provide an indication of the additional level of control required to achieve elimination. Moreover, monitoring whether transmission changes throughout the trial could provide an indication as to whether the effectiveness of anti-malarial drugs remains the same throughout the trial, which is an important consideration in light of concerns about drug resistance.
Technical SummaryMalaria is estimated to cause around 1 million deaths per year, with the majority of these deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa, primarily amongst young children. Over the last decade there has been an increase in funding from high-income countries and global agencies and renewed interest in achieving local elimination in various regions and the prospects of global eradication of the disease.
Measuring progress towards elimination requires an estimate of the reduction in transmission that has occurred over time and the proximity to the threshold reproduction number value of one. However, these changes are not linearly related to measures of disease prevalence and burden (the quantities often used to track progress).
The first aim of this project is to develop and adapt methods used for reproduction number estimation in epidemic models to estimate the changes in transmission which have occurred in an area of Western Kenya which has served as a key focus for malaria research over the past few decades. This will provide estimates of the additional control necessary to achieve elimination in an area of intense transmission with high LLIN coverage. It will also provide insights into the direct and indirect effects of insecticide treated nets and how this varies during a long-term intervention.
The second objective of this fellowship is to estimate the impact of different control strategies involving the mass administration of artemisinin combination therapy on transmission during a forthcoming trial in the same area. The detailed data likely to be collected during this trial will be used to estimate transmission at a high spatial and temporal resolution. Using the results from the first part of the project of the level of transmission and trajectory of changing transmission prior to the trial, I will then assess the extent to which reductions in prevalence are likely to be sustainable and the prospects for elimination, both within the study area and more generally
","The aims of this project are to:
1. Collate data and describe changes in measures of endemicity, transmission and the implementation of malaria interventions in Western Kenya over the last two decades;
2. Develop methods to estimate underlying changes in transmission and the spatial spread of transmission during a trial of insecticide-treated nets;
3. Estimate historical trends in transmission and progress towards elimination in terms of the reproduction number in Western Kenya;

In the absence of an effective malaria vaccine, chemical control of the mosquito vector through the use of insecticides remains the best weapon to fight malaria transmission. Insecticide resistance in mosquitoes is however on the rise, and novel methods to control mosquito populations are urgently needed.
Anopheles gambiae are the most effective malaria vectors, in part due to a high reproductive rate that maintains large population densities. One of the most promising novel opportunities for vector control is reducing the reproductive output of these mosquitoes by introducing genetic sterility in natural populations.
The knowledge generated in this project will contribute to new methods of mosquito control, and eventually to a healthier populace in regions now devastated by malaria.
","Using molecular, genetic and genomics tools, the ""Targeting the reproductive interactome of the malaria vector Anopheles gambiae"" project will expand our fundamental understanding of the reproductive biology and physiology of An. gambiae.

Characterization of the sodium channel mutations involved in insecticide resistance,http://www.malariaeradication.org/mesa-track/characterization-sodium-channel-mutations-involved-insecticide-resistance,Project,Sep-10,Aug-13,,$408 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,Auburn University,Nannan Liu,,"Mosquito-borne diseases, including malaria, are the number-one killers of humans worldwide. A major obstacle in controlling these diseases is that mosquitoes have developed resistance to insecticides.
The long-term goals of the proposed research are to determine molecular mechanisms that control the mosquito's response to insecticides and to use this information to develop novel, more effective therapies to prevent resistance development, to control resistant mosquitoes and, ultimately, to reduce mosquito-borne diseases and their impact.
A large number of studies showed that point mutations of sodium channels reduce sodium channel sensitivity to pyrethroid insecticides and that, in turn, such mutations confer pyrethroid resistance. Despite such findings, there is still no comprehensive, global picture of the mutations involved in an entire sodium channel gene that contributes to insecticide resistance in any insect, including the mosquito.
This proposal is seeking an answer to the question: How many mutations, both synonymous and nonsynonymous, in an entire sodium channel are involved in insecticide resistance in the mosquito? Preliminary research has isolated cDNAs of the full-length sodium channels from Culex quinquefasciatus S- Lab and the HAmCqG0, HAmCqG8, MoAmCqG0, and MoAmCqG8 mosquitoes, and 25 mutations (7 nonsynonymous and 18 synonymous) have been identified.
The objective of the proposed research is to characterize the 25 sodium channel mutations in 7 mosquito strains, in 2 mosquito lines, and in 16 groups of mosquitoes that will be treated with different concentrations of permethrin. This characterization will determine which mutations or mutation combinations are involved in pyrethroid insecticide.
Our hypotheses are that: (a) mutations involved in pyrethroid insecticide resistance (""key mutations"") are prevalent in mosquito populations following insecticide selection and (b) the ""key"" mutation prevalence is related to the level of insecticide resistance. We predict that the introduction of the mutations or mutation combinations into the wild (susceptible)-type mosquito sodium channel will decrease the sensitivity of the sodium channel, in response to pyrethroid treatment.
Our specific aims are to:
Define the relationship between the level of insecticide resistance, and the prevalence of sodium channel mutations and mutation combinations,
Determine the effects of key mutations on sodium channel sensitivity to pyrethroids, and
Determine the relationship between the allelic expression of key mutations in the mosquito sodium channel at the DNA level and at the RNA level.
The proposed research uniquely focuses on all of the mutations that naturally occur in an entire mosquito sodium channel, which directly reflects field populations of mosquitoes that are known to naturally have multiple sodium channel mutations.
This study is also unique in its characterizing the effects not only of nonsynonymous but also of synonymous mutations on sodium channel sensitivity to pyrethroids. Characterizing the roles of nonsynonymous and synonymous mutations or mutation combinations in an entire mosquito sodium channel is an important, early step in understanding molecular mechanisms involved in sodium channel insensitivity-mediated resistance and, ultimately, in informing the development of novel treatments to control mosquitoes and to prevent mosquito-borne diseases, in particular malaria.

Transcriptomics and Population Genetics of Mosquito Resistance to Pyrethroids,http://www.malariaeradication.org/mesa-track/transcriptomics-and-population-genetics-mosquito-resistance-pyrethroids,Project,Mar-12,Feb-15,,$422 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,"University of California, Irvine",Mariangela Bonizzoni,,"The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates 500 million clinical cases of malaria and about one million deaths per year. The majority of malaria morbidity and mortality occurs in sub-Saharan Africa. Malaria prevention relies primarily on insecticide-based vector control. The same classes of insecticide used in vector control strategies also are used as pesticides for agricultural purposes. The extensive and multifaceted use of insecticides has led to the emergence and rapid spread of resistance.
A key element in resistance management is the identification of resistance mechanisms, which would allow for the development of more reliable resistance monitoring tools and resistance management strategies.
The understanding of the molecular mechanisms of insecticide resistance in Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes, the most important malaria vector in sub-Saharan Africa, has progressed in association with technological advancement. In particular, gene amplification-based techniques have allowed the identification of point mutations in coding regions of the para-type sodium channel gene that causes reduced sensitivity of the encoded protein to pyrethroid insecticides.
Microarray techniques have taken the analyses of insecticide resistance mechanisms to genome-wide expression profiling. However, microarrays can only determine the relative transcription levels of the genes spotted on the array;genes not represented in the array will be missed, and sequence variation of resistance-related genes will not be examined.
High-throughput genome- wide RNA profiling based on the RNA-seq technology is emerging as an improved method for expression studies. The whole transcriptome of mosquitoes is sampled by RNA-seq, and more precise measurement of transcription levels can be obtained. Furthermore, this new technique makes it possible to quantitatively measure known and novel isoforms and detect molecular polymorphisms in resistance-related transcripts.
The objective of this application is to use RNA-seq technique to better understand the molecular mechanisms of pyrethroid resistance in An. gambiae mosquitoes.
The Specific Aims are:
To use RNA-seq technology to determine transcriptome changes and molecular polymorphisms associated with pyrethroid resistance and
To use a population genetics approach to determine the role of the resistance candidate genes on resistance phenotypes in field An. gambiae mosquitoes from Kenya.
This project will significantly enhance the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of insecticide resistance in An. gambiae, and may lead to the development of more reliable resistance monitoring tools.

Existing malaria control insecticides - without the evolution of insecticide-resistance,http://www.malariaeradication.org/mesa-track/existing-malaria-control-insecticides-without-evolution-insecticide-resistance,Project,Jun-10,May-13,,$562 848,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,Pennsylvania State University,Andrew F. Read,,"Insecticides are among the cheapest, most effective and best proven methods of controlling malaria but as historical and contemporary experience shows, mosquitoes can rapidly evolve resistance.
We wish to test the hypothesis that existing public health insecticides could be made to deliver excellent malaria control without driving the evolution of insecticide resistant mosquitoes simply by using their active ingredients at lower concentrations. This hypothesis, which is completely opposite to conventional wisdom, derives from the observation that current insecticide paradigms indiscriminately target all adult mosquitoes and thus impose immense selection for resistance, whereas malaria is actually transmitted by only a small faction of mosquitoes (old, infected individuals).
If insecticides targeted only those dangerous mosquitoes, and avoided all the others, particularly the young reproductively-active mosquitoes most responsible for evolutionary change, then it would be possible to impose strong disease control without imposing strong 'natural'selection for insecticide resistance.
It is our contention that old, diseased mosquitoes will be vulnerable to insecticide concentrations that are too low to kill young vigorous mosquitoes. We therefore want to experimentally determine whether lower concentrations of active ingredients can be used to selectively excise the dangerous mosquitoes. If this lateral idea is correct, then very simple, easy to implement changes in current formulations could be used to ensure that our existing insecticides - which demonstrably provide excellent malaria control when used on bed nets or in house spraying campaigns - can continue as leading malaria control tools for the foreseeable future

Therefore, novel control strategies are needed.
One of these is the replacement of vector populations by non-vector ones to disrupt parasite transmission by taking advantage of observed natural refractoriness to infection in mosquitoes. This requires a good understanding of the factors impacting vectorial competence in natural populations of Anopheles and of the complex interactions between the mosquito vector and the Plasmodium parasite. If progress has been made to elucidate these interactions in An. gambiae, nothing is still known for the other major vector An. funestus.

Insecticide-impregnated bed nets and indoor-residual spray are the most effective means of mosquito vector control.
The insecticides of choice for bed nets and indoor-residual spray are pyrethroids because of their high efficacy, rapid rate of knockdown, and low mammalian toxicity. However, pyrethroid resistance has been reported in An. sinensis populations throughout China in bioassays, and this has significantly hindered the effectiveness of the recently proposed malaria elimination program in China. Early detection of insecticide resistance and resistance surveillance are critical to resistance management and to the rational use of insecticides.

This application will test central hypothesis that combination of genetic mapping, transcriptome sequencing and functional genomics approaches will greatly improve our understanding of molecular mechanisms of An. sinensis mosquito resistance to deltamethrin.

Main,,"Complex and evolving mechanisms of insecticide resistance in malaria vectors Malaria is a major public health issue in endemic countries like Mali. Insecticide treated bed net (ITN) campaigns have been very successful in reducing transmission, but the long term effectiveness of ITNs is being threatened by the complex and rapid evolution of insecticide resistance in the major vector species, like A. coluzzii.
For example, we recently described adaptive introgression as a mechanism by which A. coluzzii acquired resistance. In this case the well-­- characterized target-­-site resistance allele, kdr-, was transferred from the sister species A. gambiae into A. coluzzii via hybridization. Insecticide resistance in A. coluzzii also likely involves increased activity of metabolic genes like CYP9K1, a P450 cytochrome monooxygenase gene. CYP9K1 has been associated with resistance in two gene expression studies.
Furthermore, our preliminary results show evidence for selection on cis-regulatory variation and increased copy number at CYP9K1 since the start of an ITN campaign in 2006. A. coluzzii has significantly increased in proportion in the population since 2006, suggesting that kdr-w and alleles at CYP9K1 confer a relative fitness advantage.
In this study, we will examine the relative effects of an introgressed coding mutation (kdr-w), cis-regulatory variation at CYP9K1, and increased copy number of CYP9K1 on gene expression and insecticide resistance in A. coluzzii. Improving our understanding of the complex ways in which vector mosquitoes adapt to insecticide exposure will inform strategies aimed at managing resistance. For example, our results on the contribution of CYP9K1 to insecticide resistance may support the usefulness of adding PBO, a P450 inhibitor, to insecticide treated bed nets

Chan School of Public Health","George Christophides, Flaminia Catteruccia",,"Mosquitoes represent a major threat for human health, as they transmit a variety of infectious diseases that cause the death and suffering of millions of people each year. Among the most prominent infectious diseases is malaria, which is transmitted exclusively by mosquitoes of the Anopheles genus. Current strategies aimed at tackling this disease rely extensively on the control of vector populations in the field, mainly through the use of insecticide indoor residual sprays and insecticide-impregnated bednets. However, insurgence of resistance in mosquitoes and the lack of novel insecticidal compounds are major hurdles in the fight against malaria, and novel ideas and tools are urgently needed.
This proposal focuses on the reproductive biology of the species of mosquito primarily responsible for the transmission of malaria in Africa, known as Anopheles gambiae. An. gambiae mosquitoes mate only once in their lifetime, which means that disrupting the reproductive process offers a good way of dramatically reducing natural populations in Africa. When they mate, the male mosquito transfers sperm to the female and then afterwards transfers a coagulated mass of proteins and seminal fluids known as a mating plug, which is formed in the male accessory glands (MAGs), the mosquito equivalent of the human prostate.
The MAGs have been shown by a number of studies to play a very important role in An. gambiae fertility. Transfer of MAG secretions (mainly proteins and lipids) to female mosquitoes has been shown to reduce the female willingness to mate again. Furthermore, our previous studies have shown that transfer of the mating plug is essential for the correct storage of sperm in the female, and hence for female fertility. A deeper knowledge of factors and mechanisms shaping the function of the MAGs would undoubtedly provide novel tools and ideas for the control of mosquito populations in the field through the manipulation of their fertility.
As an example, if molecular mechanisms ensuring male fertility were identified, then we could design chemicals to inhibit such mechanisms that could be delivered to field mosquitoes in order to limit their reproductive output. In this project we will perform a detailed analysis of the MAGs, unravelling their functions in regulating mosquito reproductive success.
In particular, we will assess whether the MAGs are regulating male behaviour, and we will analyse the roles in fertility of small peptide hormones produced in these reproductive organs. The results obtained here will remarkably improve our knowledge of the reproductive processes occurring in Anopheles mosquitoes, and will provide us with tremendous opportunities to translate this knowledge into practical tools for vector control.
Our study will focus on An. gambiae mosquitoes, however it could subsequently be extended to other insect pests of medical and agricultural importance. We anticipate that this project will have a profound impact on malaria research, and will contribute to the training and scientific excellence of the next generation of scientists.
","In Objective 1, we will unravel the role of the MAGs in shaping mosquito fertility and behaviour, by performing a combination of transcriptional and functional studies that will reveal the multifaceted activities of these tissues. In Objective 2 we will instead focus on the assessment of the role of peptide hormones produced in the MAGs on the fertility and reproductive behaviour of mosquitoes. Results obtained in both objectives will then be validated in field mosquitoes in Objective 3.
This study will reveal as yet unknown molecular mechanisms underlying reproductive success in mosquitoes, considerably increasing our knowledge beyond the state-of-the-art and critically contributing with innovative tools and ideas to the fight against malaria.

Reducing Parasite Transmission Across a Varied Lanscape: Ecological and Social Contexts of a Malaria Intervention,http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0723770&HistoricalAwards=false,Project,Sep-07,Aug-13,,$1 700 000,US National Science Foundation (NSF),,,Michigan State University (MSU),"Edward Walker, Joseph Messina",,"In this proposal, Dr. Walker and colleagues address ecological resiliency and stability of the malaria disease system in a holoendemic area of sub-Saharan Africa (lowland, western Kenya) when it is manipulated intentionally by intensive implementation of insecticide treated bed nets (ITNs) to reduce transmission.
Research activities consist of 3 integrated components.
First, the effects of ITN implementation on the population dynamics and population genetics of the main malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae will be quantitated, with attention to population equilibrium density, spatial relationships to landscape factors and transmission intensity, population genetic effective population size, and gene flow. Target site insecticide resistance factors (so-called knockdown resistance or kdr) will be used as a marker for empirical analysis of gene flow. The magnitude of the ratio of Anopheles gambiae to its sister species Anopheles arabiensis is postulated to be a valid measure of the intensity of the ITN effect. Anopheles gambiae populations are postulated not to respond to density reductions with compensating reductions in density-dependent mortality. The magnitude and underlying mechanism of the so-called ?community effect? of ITNs is postulated to be related to a change from aggregated to random distribution of vectors combined with a reduced density owing to mortality. ITN implementation is further postulated to deepen the normally shallow population structure of this species, will restrict gene flow, will reduce populations to levels below density equilibrium, increase the value of the arabiensis:gambiae ratio, and will shift adult female distribution from highly aggregated to more random relative to quantified landscape structure.
Secondly, the effects of ITN implementation on population genetic structure of the primary malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum will be measured, using a combination of microsatellite markers, and frequencies of alleles operating at dihydrofolate antibiotic resistance and virulence (MSP-1) gene loci. It is hypothesized that a parasite population structure will deepen into a highly clonal one, such that gene flow of alleles conferring drug resistance and related to virulence will be restricted. Parasites will be sampled from the mosquito population at the diploid oocyst stage, to obtain clones for study. The generalized hypothesis that reduction in transmission rate confers selection pressure for more virulent parasite strains will be tested by examining whether those alleles at MSP-1 associated with higher virulence indeed increase in frequency with intensive ITN use. Male gametocytes are postulated to be favored, owing to limits on parasite population sexual reproduction as densities of parasites decline.
Thirdly, the acceptability and utilization patterns by the human population of ITNs will be examined in the social science context under conditions where that population has extensive experience and knowledge of ITN use, compared to human populations that do not have this experience. Whether spatial patterns of ITN use conform to risk maps of malaria based upon spatial variations in transmission intensity will be examined.

Identification of Genes that Cause Sterility in Male Malaria Mosquitoes,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8809981,Project,Dec-14,Nov-16,,$183 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,"University of California, Riverside",Bradley J. White,,"Over the past decade, malaria deaths in Sub-Saharan Africa decreased nearly 40% primarily due to increased use of insecticides that target the Anopheles mosquito vector. However, both physiological and behavioral resistance in the mosquito population threatens the sustainability of current control efforts. In order to capitalize upon the success of the past decade, novel control techniques need to be integrated with more judicious use of insecticides.
The sterile insect technique involves mass-rearing of male mosquitoes, which are then sterilized via irradiation and released into the wild to mate with females. While conceptually simple and successfully deployed in other insects, the sterile insect technique has not worked on African Anopheles primarily because irradiation reduces the overall fitness of males, making them poor competitors relative to wild type males.
Our proposal aims to use a cutting-edge, combinatorial genomics approach to identify genes that are critical to male fertility, laying the foundation for creating male mosquitoes that are sterile, but otherwise normal.
A majority of the important malaria vectors in Africa belong to the Anopheles gambiae complex, which consists of at least eight morphologically identical -- but genetically, behaviorally, and ecological distinct -- species. While the diversity of the Afrotropical vectorial system is normally regarded as an impediment to malaria control, we plan to use it to our advantage: classical studies showed that when two species within the An. gambiae complex are reciprocally crossed the F1 hybrid males are completely sterile. However, F1 hybrid females are fully fertile and can be backcrossed to generate recombinant male progeny that range from completely sterile to fully fertile, providing the foundation to connect genotype with phenotype.
We plan to dissect the genetic basis of hybrid male sterility between the two vector species An. gambiae and An. merus. By combining high-throughput quantitative genomics with targeted trasncriptomics and publically-available population genetic data our approach will result in a select list of candidate sterility genes. Ultimately, our project aims to use the complexity of the African vectorial system against itself;identification of genes critical to proper sperm development will enable new strategies for vector control through population suppression.

Genome-wide association studies to map genetic variation underlying mosquito susceptibility to human malaria,http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/project/E33019B7-9425-40E5-ACC4-B7E42267CB95,Project,Jan-12,Nov-14,,$1 500 310,"Medical Research Council (MRC), UK",,,Imperial College London,Mara K. N. Lawniczak,,"Understanding the molecular basis of mosquito susceptibility to Plasmodium infection and thus malaria transmission is fundamental to implementing vector-based malaria control strategies.
To date, genotypic interactions between Anopheles gambiae and Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest of the human malarias, have only been examined in one study. This work detected that genotype-by-genotype (g*g) interactions were the major determinants of the outcome of infection such that no parasite genotype was able to infect all mosquito families, and likewise, no mosquito family was able to resist all parasite genotypes. This finding highlights the complexity of the interaction and motivates research particularly aimed at dissecting the molecular basis of g*g interactions: which molecules lead to different infection outcomes due to their genetic variation?
I will use genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in the two major sub-Saharan African malaria vectors, A. gambiae and A. arabiensis, to map genetic variation associated with P. falciparum susceptibility. Lab mosquitoes will be infected with different combinations of recently collected Senegalese parasites that will constitutively express green or red fluorescent protein, allowing the infection success of individual parasite genotypes to be assessed when mosquitoes are fed mixtures of two parasite genotypes. Field mosquitoes will be fed parasites from local gametocyte carriers. GWAS will be carried out using a genotyping chip that interrogates 400,000 SNPs in the mosquito genome. By comparing susceptible to refractory mosquitoes, small regions of the mosquito genome associated with large impacts on the outcome of the infection will be identified. Candidate genes falling in these regions and potentially involved in mosquito susceptibility will be phenotypically characterised using RNA-interference gene knockdown techniques.
The molecular nature of g*g interactions and the role of mosquito species in P. falciparum susceptibility is crucial to examine because success of any vector control strategy will depend on application to all of the malaria vectors. Molecules found to be consistently involved in infection outcomes become prime targets for transmission blocking interventions, such as drugs and vaccines. Targeting mosquitoes is an effective malaria transmission reduction strategy as evidenced by the historical and current successes of insecticides and bednets. However, insecticides and bednets will fail as mosquitoes evolve insecticide resistance and bednet avoidance. New vector-based malaria control strategies will depend on a deep understanding of the molecular interactions between vectors and parasites. The efforts described here will further our understanding of the connection between genotype and phenotype in a system that is of great human interest.
","Targeting the mosquitoes that transmit the disease has proven to be the most effective strategy towards reducing the number of malaria cases. As mosquitoes tend to bite at night and indoors, the increased use of bednets in recent years has contributed to the decrease of malaria cases. However, some mosquitoes are showing evidence of increased biting in the daytime and outdoors where bednets offer no protection, so new methods of control must be developed.
Based on the fact that some mosquitoes are better malaria transmitters than others, this project aims to investigate the differences in the genetic make-up of these mosquitoes using a technology that intimately examines the mosquito genome. This comparison and follow-up tests will identify genes that are associated with mosquito capacity to carry the most deadly of the human malarias. Discovering the mosquito genes that have a big impact on malaria transmission is an essential step towards the promising strategy of developing drugs and vaccines that target the parasite while it is in the mosquito.","Basic science, Entomology",Measurement of transmission

Insecticide resistance in mosquitoes is however on the rise, and novel methods to control mosquito populations are urgently needed.
As an alternative tool for malaria control, the use of Wolbachia endosymbionts has been widely proposed as these bacterial infections are able to spread rapidly through insect populations and render hosts resistant to co-infections with disease-causing pathogens, including Plasmodium. Previous efforts to find these bacteria in Anopheles species were unsuccessful, however we recently discovered a novel Wolbachia strain, which we called wAnga, in natural populations of several species of Anopheles mosquitoes in Burkina Faso, West Africa.

The tremendous geographical heterogeneity of malaria epidemiology in this region is associated with diverse vector systems with different vectorial capacities for the parasites.As the major measures of malaria control strategies, insecticide-treated bed nets and indoor sprays have resulted in pyrethroid resistance, and greatly reshaped the mosquito community and population structures.
In Hainan Island of China, extensive use of insecticides for malaria control has led to an initially sharp decrease and recently rebound of Anopheles miminus, the key malaria vector in China and Southeast Asia. Not only has the insecticide-driven vector population succession restructured the vector community, but also the resurged mosquito population displayed altered biting preference.
Based on these observations, we hypothesize that recent intensive malaria vector control measures and agricultural pest control measures have caused a significant ecological species succession and population genetic bottleneck of malaria vectors in Hainan Island, China.
Therefore, this FIRCA proposal aims to take the advantage of geographical isolation of Hainan Island to elucidate the evolution of a major malaria vector in response to insecticide control. We will determine whether the different ecotypes of An. minimus from hilly and plain areas have different vectorial competence to Plasmodium falciparum infections.

The genetics of behavioral resistance in Anopheles gambiae (M),http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8808390,Project,Dec-14,Nov-16,Equatorial Guinea,$215 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,Texas A&M University,Michel A. Slotman,,"Malaria control depends crucially on two widespread control methods;long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS). Both methods rely on the indoor application of insecticides, and successfully target vectors that feed and rest indoors. The efficacy of LLINs and IRS is threatened by insecticide resistance and changes in the mosquito's behavior. This behavioral resistance involves vectors shifting towards outdoor biting and resting. While the biological basis of insecticide resistance is well-studied, nothing is known about the genetic basis of behavioral resistance.
The malaria vector Anopheles gambiae (M) on Bioko Island has been subjected to IRS under the Bioko Island Malaria Control Project (BIMCP) since 2004. This has resulted in a shift of this mosquito's behavior towards outdoor host seeking. Because the bendiocarb insecticide used on Bioko has low repellency, and because the outdoor biting rate was the same one vs. five months following spraying, we hypothesize that the behavioral resistance of this population has a strong genetic basis.
We will use a DNA pooling and whole genome sequencing approach to map loci involved in outdoor biting in the An. gambiae (M) population on Bioko Island. Outdoor and indoor biting mosquitoes were collected using human landing catches as part of the vector monitoring of the BIMCP from 2009 to 2013. Outdoor and indoor samples from 2009 and 2013 will be pooled and sequenced. This will produce >2,000,000 SNPs that will be used to identify alleles that occur at significantly higher frequency in the outdoor vs the indoor biting mosquitoes.
We have developed a novel simulation approach for establishing the false discovery rate (=significance threshold). This approach will identify loci responsible for variation in host seeking behavior in post-control populations.
Preliminary results show that we will be able to identify alleles that differ in frequency by 0.069. In addition, we will identify loci that increased in frequency followng the vector control by comparing pre-intervention samples collected in 2004 to post-control 2009 and 2013 samples. Simulations that incorporate genetic drift and sampling effects will provide the false discovery rate, allowing the identification of loci under positive selection. These two approaches will provide a list of candidate loci underlying behavioral resistance in a major malaria vector. This will be the first study into the biological basis of behavioral resistance and takes the first step towards developing the tools to monitor or counteract this major threat to our vector control tools.

This application will focus on resistance mechanisms in an important malaria vector in Southern China, Anopheles minimus C. The central hypothesis is that both knockdown resistance (kdr) and metabolic detoxification confer resistance to pyrethroids in An. minimus, and consequently, the resistance level of a mosquito to pyrethroids is contingent on mutations in kdr gene and monooxygenase activity.The kdr gene polymorphism in natural populations will be determined, and correlations between the kdr mutations, monooxygenase activity with pyrethroid resistance phenotype will be examined.

Possible detrimental effects include selection for insecticide resistance, and/or shifts in be haviours. Inherent difficulties in reliably sampling vector populations in the field have impeded accurate measurement of the impact of ITNs on mosquito behaviour and survival.

The Gambia is the ideal place to carry out the proposed research program because 1. The country has been extremely successful in reducing the malaria burden and aims at reducing it further; 2. The MRC laboratories have the required expertise, the advanced technological platform and the necessary international collaborations to achieve the program's objectives. The combination of these two factors is unique in West Africa and offers a golden opportunity to carry out a research programme that can have a profound influence on the way elimination efforts will be implemented in sub-Saharan Africa.
Activities are divided into two parallel and complementary sections: one section aims at understanding the dynamics of malaria transmission and the reasons why this can substantially differ within few kilometres; the other section will aim at improving diagnostic tests able to identify malaria infected but otherwise healthy people (malaria carriers).
For the former, the populations of 12 villages will be intensively followed up for 3 transmission seasons to understand who the malaria carriers are and how the infection spreads across the populations. Information on the vector population, including the presence of insecticide resistance, and on the human behaviour will be collected to partly explain the likely differences between the study villages.
At the end of the study we will have a better understanding on how the malaria parasites spread and what are the important determinants that maintain transmission from one year to the other, despite the high coverage of preventive and curative measures.
Concerning diagnostic tests, the currently available tests that can be used in the field cannot detect a proportion of infected people that contributes in maintaining transmission. We will try two approaches, one aiming at developing easy-to-use molecular test that can detect most infected individuals, and the other looking at ""markers"" of infection by detecting parasite's or host's proteins that can be found only in infected individuals. The latter could provide the knowledge necessary to develop a more sensitive test.

Targeting male mosquito mating behavior for vector control,http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/project/6EC2A04E-8A40-4A32-9902-FD05C45671CB#,Project,May-11,May-16,Burkina Faso,$1 603 000,"Medical Research Council (MRC), UK",,,"Keele University, UK","Frederic Tripet, Abdoulaye Diabate",,"Malaria remains a major cause of mortality in many parts of Africa. The control of mosquito populations remains one of the most efficient ways of decreasing the incidence of the disease. This is commonly done by using insecticide-impregnated bednets or by spraying houses. In many areas of Africa however, mosquito populations are becoming resistant to commonly used pesticides. There is thus an urgent need for exploring and developing novel approaches to control or eradicate mosquito populations.
Here, two medical entomologists from Burkina Faso and the UK join their expertise to propose an extensive research program focusing on the male reproductive behaviour of Anopheles gambiae, the main vector of malaria in Africa. Male mating behaviour is a key aspect of the mosquito life-cycle and an aspect of their biology that is crucial for the development of several promising vector control strategies. Anopheles gambiae mates in flying aggregations or swarms in which they choose their mate and copulate. Swarms would constitute an ideal target for mosquito population control but very little is known about the cues that male mosquitoes use to locate and initiate their swarms.
Here, the researchers propose to build on recent findings from months of observation of swarm formation in their natural habitats to explore the feasibility of predicting and manipulating swarm location for mass killing. Male mating behaviour is also crucial for vector control programs aiming to release sterile male mosquitoes that mate with wild females and induce their sterility and for programs aiming to introduce genes of refractoriness to malaria into mosquito populations via genetically-modified mosquitoes. So far laboratory-reared male mosquitoes have been unable to mate with wild females effectively thereby casting doubt on the efficiency of mosquito releases.
An important part of the research program will thus focus on understanding what determines male mating success in swarms with the goal of improving the mating performance of laboratory-reared male mosquitoes. The proposed research studies will include ecological experiments in specially designed large outdoor cages and selected villages in Burkina Faso and will also benefit from the latest molecular advances in the laboratories of the UK partner institution. The novel approaches are expected to strongly impact this field of research and soon benefit communities from countries endemic for malaria by enabling new mosquito control strategies.

Besansky,,"About 800,000 people die each year from malaria. While the currently available vector control tools-mainly bed nets and indoor insecticide spraying-are substantially reducing malaria cases and deaths, this public health success is fragile due to the threat of resistance. Moreover, even without resistance, existing tools are insufficient to interrupt malaria transmission where it is high and stable, as in many parts of Africa. The development of new vector-targeted tools is imperative, but depends on an understanding of mosquito ecology and behavior that is currently lacking.
Here we study saltwater tolerance, a trait found in numerous important malaria vectors that plays a key role in determining habitat use and ecological distribution of mosquitoes, and thus their contribution to malaria transmission.Our objective is to dissect the genetic basis of saltwater tolerance in the African malaria vector An. merus, a close relative of the primary vector An. gambiae. We will dissect saltwater tolerance in An. merus through two complementary specific aims:
1. Genetically map QTLs that contribute to salinity tolerance in An. merus Using multiple colonies of An. merus and An. gambiae, we have shown that An. merus can be distinguished from An. gambiae and their F1 hybrids by survival in 50% seawater. We will apply a novel Illumina-based genotyping approach to map recombination breakpoints in individual backcross progeny that do/do not survive exposure to 50% seawater, to localize QTL regions that control salinity tolerance.
2. Identify differential gene expression associated with development in fresh vs. saltwater
We have shown that the ability of An. merus to survive in 50% seawater is dependent upon developmental timing of exposure, and that the localization of an ion transporting protein (Na/K ATPase) in the rectum differs in fresh vs. saltwater-reared larvae. We hypothesize that these observations are due to differential expression triggered by exposure to saltwater. We will test this hypothesis and identify candidate genes by comparing global gene expression between fresh vs. saltwater-reared larvae.
At the end of the two-year project, combined evidence from QTL mapping and differential gene expression will lead us to candidate genes and/or candidate gene regions that contribute to salinity tolerance in the malaria vector An. merus. Unlike other complex ecological, behavioral and life history traits of epidemiological importance that are probably polygenic, saltwater tolerance is relatively tractable, likely governed by a few major loc with large effects, and simple to assay. The ability to dissect the genetic basis of this adaptive trait using next generation genomic tools lays the groundwork for future efforts to understand the mechanisms by which these vector mosquitoes adapt to a heterogeneous and changing environment, opening up new avenues of vector control.

This is unique because it will be the first vector control tool that targets both adult and larval mosquito stages simultaneously with environment-friendly control agents. We foresee the use of MCDs mostly in the outdoor environment where they will lure, infect, and contaminate host-seeking and resting females.

MCDs will be highly useful in areas where insecticide-resistance is hampering the effectiveness of current vector control tools and where behavioural adaptation of mosquito populations has shifted towards outdoor resting and biting.

Besansky,,"Malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum claims the lives of three million children per year, mainly in Africa. A vaccine is not available and chemoprophylaxis alone is unlikely to significantly reduce transmission.
Aside from the threat of insecticide resistance, existing vector control strategies that focus on indoor use of insecticides may not reach all of the disease-transmitting population or may induce a behavioral shift, given underlying population heterogeneities in vector resting and biting behavior-- even in vectors considered to be primarily ""endophilic"" and ""endophagic"" (indoor resting and biting) such as Anopheles gambiae.
In Africa, A. gambiae is the most important vector. This mosquito has adapted rapidly to climatically diverse and anthropogenic environments. Instrumental to its adaptive flexibility are polymorphic chromosomal inversions. Of particular relevance are alternative arrangements on the left arm of chromosome 2 (2La or +a) that are preferentially associated with contrasting environments (arid and humid) through entirely unknown physiological and/or behavioral mechanisms.
Based on frequency distribution maps of 2La, this arrangement reaches 100% in arid savannas while in humid rainforests only the alternative arrangement (2L+a) is found. Thus without the benefit of 2La, A. gambiae would be limited to rainforest areas where this mosquito is not necessarily the most abundant or even the best malaria vector.
At a local level, 2La reaches its highest frequency during the dry season and in samples captured resting indoors at night where the nocturnal saturation deficit is higher. Thus 2La influences a key epidemiological trait-- the probability of vector-human contact-- as well as the likelihood of vector exposure to insecticide-treated walls and bed nets, through its effect on indoor biting and resting behavior.
The ultimate goal of this project is to identify the genes and gene networks in 2La that confer resistance to aridity-- a phenotype or suite of phenotypes that leads to increased vector-human contact and malaria transmission at both local and geographic scales. To achieve this goal, we propose a multidisciplinary and integrative approach that combines phenotypic and molecular analysis to begin to tease apart the functional genomics of 2La through three specific aims:
Identify phenotypic traits associated with alternative arrangements of 2La;
Identify sequence differences between arrangements that may contribute to phenotypic differences;
Associate genotypic and phenotypic differences by comparing patterns of gene expression.
The short-term outcome of this program will be linkages between adaptive phenotypes and underlying candidate genes, leading to specific hypotheses about how 2La confers resistance to aridity and impacts the probability of vector-human contact.
The longer term benefits are two-fold. The first is improved implementation, evaluation and design of vector control, based on a mechanistic understanding of what we now call ""adaptive flexibility"". In other words, gaining a detailed understanding of genetic, physiological and behavioral attributes of 2La that are linked to aridity tolerance and indoor resting behavior will significantly improve our ability to predict the epidemiological impact of existing and novel vector control strategies, and can lead to the design of more comprehensive strategies resistant to evasion by components of the vector population. The second benefit is that a successful outcome in the study of functional genomics of aridity resistance in 2La will serve as a general model for studying the functional genomics of many other medically important traits in A. gambiae.

In addition to resistance management, novel insecticides with new modes of action - particularly for which efficacy is not affected by existing resistance mechanisms - are required.
The long-term goal is to develop a malaria vector control methodology based on a new insecticide target, the serine protease inhibitor serpin (SRPN)2 from the African malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae s.s.. SRPN2 is a key negative regulator in the extracellular proteinase cascade that controls activation of prophenoloxidase (proPO) and thus melanization - a powerful, arthropod-specific innate immune response.SRPN2 depletion from the hemolymph of adult female mosquitoes significantly reduces longevity with escalating daily mortality nine days after treatment.
The objectives in this application are to identify the interactions of SRPN2 with its proteinase targets and to evaluate the malaria control potential of a SRPN2 inhibitor. The rationale for the proposed research is that detailed information on SRPN2's biological proteinase targets and mode of action will ultimately allow the design of small molecule inhibitors of SRPN2 that could act as an insecticide for mosquito vector control.
Guided by our preliminary data, the following three specific aims will be pursued:
Determine the molecular targets of SRPN2 inhibitory function;
Determine the molecular interface between SRPN2 and its target proteinase(s);and
Model the impact of SRPN2 depletion on disease transmission.
Under the first aim, a combination of biochemical and genetic approaches that have been used successfully in the applicant's laboratory will be used to identify serine proteinase targets of SRPN2 based on their ability to (a) form covalent complexes with the serpin and (b) revert the serpin's depletion phenotype.
Under the second aim, the molecular interactions between SRPN2 and one of its target proteinases, CLIPB9, will be identified by protein crystallography and mutational analysis.
Under the third aim, the potential effect of SRPN2 inhibition on malaria transmission and resistance development against a potential SRPN2 inhibitor will be assessed by mathematical modeling.
The proposed research is innovative, as it will for the first time evaluate the mosquito immune system as a physiological target for novel insecticides. Additionally, this project will use microfluidics as a highly innovative approach to the study of mosquito innate immunity, which if successful will be transformative to the field of insect biochemistry. This project is significant as it will provide fundamental knowledge of the nature of serine proteinase cascades that regulate melanization in mosquitoes.

Develop DNA-based insecticide resistance screening tools for use by the staff of vector control programmes in the malaria and filariasis affected countries of sub-Saharan Africa.
These routine resistance screens will permit routine monitoring of mutations giving information vital for predicting the success of IRS and ITN programmes. The objective will be addressed in three specific phases:
Phase 1 - The discovery of resistance-associated loci using candidate gene association mapping and whole genome microarrays. In two focal African countries, genes potentially involved in resistance to three major IRS insecticides (DDT, Bendiocarb, ?-cyhalothrin) will be identified using two complementary approaches:- i) Variation at the DNA level will be investigated using a custom candidate gene 1536plex SNP array and ii) differential gene expression between resistant and susceptible Anopheles gambiae will be investigated via whole genome microarrays. Putative resistance-associated SNPs within and around the most promising genes or gene regulators will be taken forward to phase 2 for wider field validation.
Phase 2 - Candidate gene validation in the PMI and TDR network countries of sub-Saharan Africa. The putative resistance-associated SNPs identified in phase 1 will be screened for association with resistance in a much larger sample from a large section of sub-Saharan Africa via collaboration with extant World Health Organization/Tropical Disease Research (TDR) and President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) programmes. The aim is to screen for association of SNPs with resistance within and across populations producing a multi-site association meta-analysis to identify resistance-associated SNPs of major and/or generic effect.
Phase 3 - Integrating metabolic resistance markers into a Field Applicable Screening Tool. The final phase of the programme will involve design, testing and roll-out of a field applicable screening tool (FAST), which will comprise straightforward and robust diagnostics to be used in laboratories in the disease-affected countries. The FAST diagnostics will include the most important genetic markers for resistance to the IRS insecticides, in addition to any critical pre-identified markers (e.g. for species/ molecular form identification).
FAST roll-out will occur via collaboration with extant Innovative Vector Control Consortium (IVCC), TDR and PMI programmes. The development of insecticide resistance in Anopheles mosquitoes is a major threat to malaria control. Conventional means of assessing resistance are costly, insensitive and inaccurate. We propose to develop assays that will allow disease programme managers to detect resistance when it is still at a low frequency and before control failure has occurred.

The molecular physiology of 'kidney' function in mosquitoes: identification of molecular targets and discovery of insecticides for mosquito control,http://federalreporter.nih.gov/project_info_details.cfm?aid=598130,Project,Jun-12,Sep-17,,,,,,Ohio State University,Peter M. Piermarini,,"Mosquitoes are vectors of numerous pathogens that present a significant challenge to the health and well-being of humans and animals. Unfortunately, the present arsenal of insecticides used for mosquito control is rapidly losing its effectiveness, because insecticide resistance is evolving in mosquitoes. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop new insecticides with novel mechanisms of action to control the spread of mosquito-borne diseases.
In response to this need, the present Hatch proposal aims to facilitate the development of a new generation of insecticides that will kill mosquitoes by attacking their analog of a kidney--i.e., the Malpighian tubules. The objectives of the proposal are to:
Identify genes that play key roles in the renal functions of adult female mosquitoes (the blood-feeding life stage);
Discover chemical compounds that kill mosquitoes by impairing their renal functions.
If the objectives are met, then the proposed Hatch studies have potential to catalyze the development of a new generation of insecticides for controlling mosquitoes.

Novel methods for controlling the natural vector populations are urgently needed, given the evolution of insecticide resistance in mosquitoes and the lack of novel insecticidals.
Understanding the processes at the bases of mosquito biology may help to roll back malaria. In this proposal, we will target mosquito reproduction, a major determinant of the An. gambiae vectorial capacity. This will be achieved at two levels:
(i) fundamental research, to provide a deeper knowledge of the processes regulating reproduction in this species, and
(ii) applied research, to identify novel targets and to develop innovative approaches for the control of natural populations. We will focus our analysis on three major players of mosquito reproduction: male accessory glands (MAGs), sperm, and spermatheca, in both laboratory and field settings.
We will then translate this information into the identification of inhibitors of mosquito fertility.
","The experimental activities will be divided across three objectives:
We will unravel the role of the MAGs in shaping mosquito fertility and behaviour, by performing a combination of transcriptional and functional studies that will reveal the multifaceted activities of these tissues.
We will instead focus on the identification of the male and female factors responsible for sperm viability and function. Results obtained in both objectives will be validated in field mosquitoes.
We will perform screens aimed at the identification of inhibitors of mosquito reproductive success.
This study will reveal as yet unknown molecular mechanisms underlying reproductive success in mosquitoes, considerably increasing our knowledge beyond the state-of-the-art and critically contributing with innovative tools and ideas to the fight against malaria.","Basic science, Entomology",Tools for elimination

Malaria Vaccine Based on Self-Assembling Polypeptide Nanoparticles (SAPN),http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8307982,Project,Sep-09,Aug-14,,$2 100 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,University of Connecticut,Peter Burkhard,,"The development of a vaccine against P. falciparum has proven to be a difficult bioengineering challenge. Malaria afflicts 500 million people worldwide and annually kills about 3 million people, mostly children. ""RTS,S"", the most successful malaria vaccine candidate to date, provides only about 40% protective efficacy in humans in clinical and field challenge studies, and it requires formulation with an adjuvant to achieve protective immunogenicity.
The application's broad, long-term objective is to develop self-assembling polypeptide nanoparticles (SAPN) as the basis for a P. falciparum malaria vaccine that is potentially more protective than those currently in clinical trials, shows excellent heat stability, and can be delivered without an adjuvant, which is likely to be consistent with formulations suited for delivery without a cold chain. SAPN assemble from linear polypeptide (LP) building blocks. Each LP consists of pentameric and trimeric coiled-coil domains separated by a linker, with epitope antigens displayed internally and on the N- and C- termini.
The proposed work aims to identify the best configuration for the display of B cell and T cell epitopes on SAPN for producing the most potent immunogenic and protective immune response. SAPN displaying the P. berghei CSP epitope (analogous to the P. falciparum CSP B-cell epitope in RTS,S) have been shown to stimulate a long lasting protective immune response against a lethal sporozoite challenge in the P. berghei mouse malaria model without the need for an adjuvant.
The SAPN particles have been shown themselves to have adjuvant activity. This suggests that the SAPN platform is potentially superior to other protein vaccine technologies used to date as these have all required the addition of extraneous adjuvants to be protective. The SAPN vaccines in our development pipeline will be evaluated for their mechanism of immune enhancement (adjuvanticity);protective efficacy against challenge with a strain of P. berghei (mouse malaria) expressing the CSP transgene from P. falciparum (human malaria);and immunogenic/protective response provided by specific P. falciparum T cell epitopes in human HLA backgrounds using human-HLA transgenic mice.
The Specific Aims are to: 
Design and produce SAPN in order to determine the optimal density of the immunodominant PfCSP B-cell epitope to stimulate a potent antibody response
Determine the enhancement to the immune response provided by the addition of pan allelic HTL and CTL epitopes to SAPN with the optimized density of immunodominant PfCSP B cell epitope;and
Evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and immune response to the lead PfCSP SAPN vaccine candidate in a non-human primate (NHP) model.
This R&D plan is expected to advance an innovative vaccine platform and to develop a malaria vaccine based on B cell and T cell epitope antigens from P. falciparum CSP that have already demonstrated successful, though limited, protective efficacy in clinical and field trials as RTS,S in AS02A. Success should qualify the proposed research for further funding for human- use product development and vaccine trials. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A malaria vaccine will be developed based on a new technology, self-assembling peptide nanoparticles, that display malaria parasite immunogens previously shown to elicit protective immunity to malaria. This new vaccine platform holds promise for ultimately producing an inexpensive malaria vaccine for the developing world.

With regard to the annual toll of people killed, malaria remains one of the deadliest diseases in the world today, as it has been so for thousands of years. For each of the 1 million people killed each year there are hundreds that are severely sickened by malaria parasites.
Indeed, malaria is one of the most frequent causes of sickness and death in the world today but especially in sub-Saharan Africa where its victims are primarily young children and pregnant women. And the situation is worsening due to the emergence and spread of strains of Plasmodium parasites that harbor resistance to multiple drugs including: the quinolines - chloroquine, quinine, and mefloquine;the antifolates - pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine;and the anti-respiratory combination of atovaquone and proguanil. In some areas of the world, especially in SE Asia, multidrug resistance has forced an absolute reliance on the endoperoxide artesunate for treatment of malaria - a razor thin wall of opposition to a total collapse of therapeutic options for malaria.
We have discovered a class of compounds which we refer to as ""Pharmachins"" with equal and potent activity against multidrug resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum including strains harboring high level resistance to chloroquine, quinine, mefloquine, Fansidar and Malarone. Our current lead molecule, Pharmachin 128 (PH128), exhibits IC50 values in the low nanomolar range against all tested strains, e.g., D6, Dd2, 7G8 and Tm90-C2B. PH128 is active by oral means of administration in P. berghei and P. yoelii-infected mice with ED50 values of ~2.7mg/kg/day and ED90 values of ~4.6mg/kg/day in modified 4-day tests (i.e., drug administration begins with demonstration of patency). These values are strikingly similar to published reports of chloroquine's action profile in these two systems. We feel that PH128 represents an excellent lead candidate to replace chloroquine.

Drugs targeting erythrocytic and exoerythrocytic stages of malaria,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8667471,Project,Sep-11,May-16,,$1 100 000,"National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS), NIH",,,University of South Florida,Roman Manetsch,,"Malaria is the most important parasitic disease of man, with over 1 million deaths per year and more than 300 million cases annually. New drugs are urgently required to combat this deadly disease. Due to a limited number of chemotypes and documented resistance to the available drugs, there is renewed international effort aimed to discover and develop new leads with potential to prevent or treat malaria.
Most antimalarial drug discovery focuses on the erythrocytic stages of malaria that cause disease, yet to eliminate malaria compounds are required to kill liver stages as well as the infective stages for mosquitoes. The only approved drug with these combined properties is primaquine, an 8-aminoquinoline (8AQ) that has weak erythrocytic stage activity and is toxic in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficient individuals.
Therefore, the most significant need for future malaria elimination efforts is a compound that is safe and effective at killing parasites at all stages of development in the patient. With the exception of 8AQs, very few compound series have demonstrated activity against the exo-erythrocytic (EE) stages in the liver as well as erythrocytic and gametocyte stages. Endochin and 4(1H)-quinolones are known to possess causal prophylactic activity (kill growing EE stage parasites) and potent erythrocytic stage inhibition in avian malaria models, but not against malaria parasites in mammals.
Furthermore, a quinolone ester ICI56,780 has been shown to produce a radical cure in P. cynomologi infected rhesus monkeys (eradicate dormant EE parasites);however, rapid development of resistance hampered its further development. Many of these studies were conducted over 20 years ago without an adequate evaluation in current preclinical efficacy models or without assessing the compounds'physicochemical properties.
The broad long term objectives of this proposal are to progress 3-alkyl and 3-(hetero)aryl-4(1H)- quinolones, tetrahydroacridones, and 7-(2-phenoxyethoxy)-4(1H)-quinolones as antimalarial agents and to determine their mechanism of action and potential for resistance by utilizing chemical and biochemical tools. The three chemotypes possess in vivo liver stage activity, in vivo blood stage activity, gametocytocidal activity, and/or activity in the mosquitoes.

In order to support the recent eradication agenda, new generations of both chemoprophylactic and chemotherapeutic antimalarials need to meet the following target product profiles:1) efficacy against multidrug-resistant malaria;2) activity against pre- erythrocytic parasites to prevent infection;3) efficacy against gametocytes for transmission blocking;4) ability to prevent relapse by targeting the hypnozoite forms of the parasites.

Functional Characterization of Artemisinin-induced Dormancy,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8804180,Project,May-13,May-15,,$76 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,University of South Florida,Sasha Victoria Siegel,,"Malaria is a major health problem worldwide, with over 250 million people becoming infected and up to 1 million deaths annually. Artemisinin and derivative compounds provide rapid relief of malaria symptoms with faster clearance of parasitemia than any other drugs. Despite the remarkable activity and broad stage specificity of artemisinin drugs, between 10-40 percent of patients experience recrudescence of the infection 7 to 28 days post-treatment. The recrudescent parasites remain susceptible to artemisinin in vitro, suggesting that the high frequency of treatment failure is not due to conventional resistance mechanisms.
We have investigated recrudescence following exposure to artemisinin in vitro and in vivo. We have shown that ring stage parasites exposed to artemisinin drugs become dormant and persist in this arrested state for hours to days in vitro before recovering and resuming cell cycle progression. Furthermore, we have shown that both artemisinin sensitive and resistant parasites enter dormancy following exposure to drug, yet resistant lines require elevated drug concentrations to induce dormancy and subsequently recrudesce earlier in vitro.
We hypothesize that the formation of dormant parasites during artemisinin treatment is not only a key factor in the high rates of treatment failure and recrudescence of infection, but also in the development of resistance to the artemisinin class of drugs.
The long-term objective of these studies is to define the novel regulatory features of cell cycle arrest and dormancy in Plasmodium falciparum, and identify the essential factors involved in the key checkpoints that regulate it. In these studies, we will characterize the transcriptional regulatory processes of Plasmodium falciparum dormancy, identify parasite genes essential for cell cycle progression through stage-specific transcriptional drug response analyses, and elucidate the metabolic signatures of resistant parasites in drug-induced arrest.
This novel research approach is innovative in two ways in that we will be functionally characterizing drug-induced dormancy, as well as simultaneously uncovering potential new drug targets and pathways. This project will enable us to grasp a better understanding of the mechanisms of parasite drug evasion strategies, and allow us to design better drugs to treat and prevent this disease.

Chloroquine Sensitive Plasmodium falciparum for MultiValent Vaccine & Challenge,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8666723,Project,Jun-13,May-15,,$598 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,Sanaria,Stephen Lev Hoffman,,"The ideal tool for eliminating Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), the causative agent of 99% of all malaria deaths, is a highly effective vaccine that entirely prevents blood stage infection and thereby prevents all disease and transmission.
Sanaria's goal is to develop and commercialize a Pf sporozoite (SPZ) vaccine that prevents Pf blood stage infection in >80% of recipients. Sanaria developed a vaccine composed of attenuated, purified, aseptic, cryopreserved PfSPZ, the PfSPZ Vaccine based on the chloroquine-sensitive NF54 strain of Pf. It is safe and well-tolerated when administered to human volunteers by intradermal (ID), subcutaneous (SC) or intravenous (IV) injection (1). It is highly immunogenic and conferred high level protection (100%) against homologous controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) when administered IV (R. Seder et al., in prep.).
Roestenberg and co-workers (2) have independently demonstrated high level (100%), long-lasting (28 months) protection with non-attenuated NF54 PfSPZ administered to chloroquine-treated volunteers by the bites of mosquitoes, an approach referred to as chemoprophylaxis with sporozoites (CPS). We have achieved successful infection of volunteers with ID administration of PfSPZ (called PfSPZ Challenge) (3), and recently infected 100% of volunteers (9/9) with IV administration of 3,200 PfSPZ (Mordmueller, in prep.). These findings with PfSPZ Challenge establish the means to rapidly translate CPS into a practical vaccine approach, termed PfSPZ-CVac, in which PfSPZ Challenge is administered with chloroquine chemoprophylaxis.
The first clinical trial of PfSPZ-CVac is now in progress. While the limited available evidence suggests that whole PfSPZ immunization can induce protection against homologous and heterologous CHMI challenge, we assume that a multivalent vaccine composed of at least 3 Pf strains of diverse geographic origin will best insure worldwide protection.
Our goal in this project is to identify chloroquine sensitiv strains of Pf that can be used: 1) in CHMI to assess the broad-spectrum efficacy of PfSPZ-based vaccines and 2) if there is a need, to include these strains as multivalent vaccine components to achieve broad efficacy. To accomplish this we will adapt to continuous culture at least 2 chloroquine sensitive strains of Pf from Africa and Asia that exhibit asexual growth and sexual stage and sporogonic development characteristics suitable for Sanaria's PfSPZ manufacturing process.
During the past 30 yrs, only a few parasite strains have been established that are capable of producing suitably abundant PfSPZ from cultured gametocytes. Achieving our aims will require Sanaria's unique, industrialized approach to PfSPZ production, including systematic screening of multiple chloroquine sensitive parasite isolates in Sanaria's R&D facility where gametocyte culture, mosquito infection, and PfSPZ extraction and quantitative analysis is carried out continuously. The ability to test heterologous protective efficacy and initiate multivalent vaccine manufacturing using heterologous Pf strains could reduce the time to market for PfSPZ vaccines by at least 2 years, with cost savings of tens to hundreds of millions of dollars.

Rational Approach to Optimize Immune Potency of DNA Vaccines,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8676649,Project,Jun-13,May-15,,$393 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,Tulane University,Nirbhay Kumar,,"Vaccines have provided the most cost-effective tool to control infectious diseases caused by viral and bacterial pathogens. However, there are no vaccines against any human parasitic infections and the development of an effective malaria vaccine remains an unachieved goal. Malaria infections account for nearly a million deaths out of ~ 300 million clinical cases globally on an annual basis.
Vaccines based on antigens targeting the sexual stages of the parasite provide a direct approach to reduce malaria transmission. Antibodies recognizing specific conformational epitopes in these proteins are potent blockers of infectivity of malaria parasites in the mosquito. In this R21 application we propose to assess cellular, molecular and immune correlates of efficacy and safety of modified DNA vaccines using a well characterized malaria vaccine candidate, Pfs25, as a model immunogen. DNA vaccines induce a good initial immune response;however, in larger mammals they require heterologous boosting, eg. adjuvanted proteins to sustain functional antibody titers.
Poor immunogenicity of DNA vaccines could result from an immune phenomenon described as T cell exhaustion or dysfunction resulting from upregulation of the programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor in activated T cells and PD-L1 on antigen presenting cells. We propose to test this hypothesis through the novel addition of an RNAi sequence (designed to knockdown PD-L1) to a DNA vaccine and expect enhanced immunogenicity of DNA vaccines reflected in higher titer and longer lasting antibody responses.
We will test our hypothesis by pursuing the following specific aims. In specific aim 1 we will develop DNA vaccines capable of silencing PD-L1 and expressing vaccine antigen within the same cell. Studies in specific aim 2 will provide a proof-of-principle through in vivo evaluation of potency of modified DNA vaccines and associated TFH cell responses. These studies will provide a better understanding of the cellular and molecular correlates of immunogenic efficacy and safety of DNA vaccines, and also provide the basis for more in depth studies on vaccine development across a broad spectrum.

Plasmodium falciparum anti-malarial drug resistance in The Gambia:Identification of potential genetic markers by retrospective whole genome approaches,http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/project/D22FEE52-9DDF-40D6-B1DA-BE7988B85503,Project,May-13,May-17,Gambia,,,,,"Medical Research Council (MRC) Unit, The Gambia ",Alfred Amambua Ngwa,,"Malaria disease from infection with the parasite Plasmodium falciparum remains an important global health problem. More information is needed to continue developing new ways of controlling the disease which infects predominantly impoverished endemic countries in sub Saharan Africa. Some of this includes information on genetic differences between different types of the parasites, particularly those that don't respond to the drugs presently used for treatment.
Malaria has developed resistance to previously available cheap drugs like chloroquine and Fansidar. Due to this strong ability to develop new ways of evading drugs and continuing transmission of infection and cause disease in other individuals, it now requires the use of new drug combinations containing the compound artemisinin (ART) to treat infections. These new drug combinations (ACTs) are more expensive and represent the only most effective treatment of malaria infections in sub saharan Africa. However, there are indications that some infections with malaria in South East Asia are not treated as effectively as expected with these new drug combinations indicating that the parasites may already be developing new mechanisms to resist the effect of these drug combinations. If this alarming development were to continue and spread to Africa it will be a big blow to the efforts to reduce the burden of malaria in the continent that bears 90% of the malaria burden.
For the scientific community to be ready for such an eventuality, it is important to start looking at factors that will enable these parasites that resist drug action to develop and spread in affected sub Saharan Arican populations. Some of these factors include the the ability of some parasites to tolerate drug concentrations that will normally kill them. The challenge in gaining understanding of the complex processes in the parasite that create the conditions for drug resistance is the requirement for large amount of data from populations where these drugs have been used for some time. Aquiring such information can now be possible by advancements in technologies for rapidly analysing the quantity and quality of genetic differences between infections before and since ACT adoption in Africa.
This project therefore seeks a better understanding of the processes that lead to antimalarial drug resistance by taking advantage of advances in new technologies to comprehensively study genetic differences in the parasites from the period before ACTs through five years of its use in the West African state, The Gambia. Use of drugs and the low level of transmission in this region is favorable for parasites to develp resistance. This information will enable the identification of genetics determinants of drug resistance and communities in which parasites that donot respond to drug are transmitted. The study will then employ methods in the lab to determine the sensitivity of these parasites to drugs being used. Those that are resistant to drugs will be analysed using genetics tools.
The study will also look at how parasites will be cleared from infected people being treated with ACTs. Communities with parasites that fail to clear from blood during treatment will be the focus of further genetic analysis to determine if genetic changes are responsible for this kind of behaviour. This project will make use of excellent collaboration between MRC Unit, The Gambia and Northern partners (UK and US) for analysis and technology transfer. The study will last for a period of 48 months and will build capacity for future population genetic research in the African sub region given the different vaccine, drug and vector interventions being implimented.
The findings from the project should also inform policy makers on developing new intervention strategies that will incorporate the percularities of populations studied. It will enable the developmeent of my research career in this field as an independent genomics scientist in West Africa. Technical Summary Reports of decreasing malaria endemicity are countered by the emergence of parasite strains resistant to new artermisinin-based drug combinations. The threat of artemisinin resistance may be a major threat for the effort to eliminate malaria, particularly in Africa where the burden is the highest.
The main goal of this proposal is therefore to identify and determine the distribution of drug resistant markers in a West African population, The Gambia, following five years of implementation of ACT. In the past few years we have developed molecular methods to study the genetics, population genomic diversity and evolution of malaria parasites in West Africa. The published genomic data and current preliminary retrospective data enable us to propose new approachees on molecular epidemiology of malaria.
The specific aims are
Characterize variation in microsatellite and single nucleotide polymorphisms in malaria infections following the implementation of ACT in The Gambia,
Determine the prevalence of resistance markers in endemic communities and
Determine the association of these polymorphisms with treatment failure and reduce drug sensitivity.
The study will employ hybrid select and Illumina sequencing of retrospective isolates in collaboration with the Broad Institute, US. High resolution drug sensitivity phenotyping of field isolates will employ new flow cytometric techniques that allow determination of the effects of artemisinin derivatives on early developmental stages of parasites. The genomes of parasites from ex vivo and in vivo studies will be genotyped in collaboration with the Wellcome Trust Sanger institute, UK.
The project will be of public health benefit in identifying and combating drug-resistant malaria, potentially enhancing the drive towards malaria elimination in the Gambia. The genomic data will be vital in studies charaterising malaria diversity. It will empower me and my research team on advanced genome informatics and statistics.

While antimalarial drugs are widely available in endemic areas, their utility is compromised by the rapid development of drug resistance by Plasmodium falciparum parasites.
All of the clinical symptoms of malaria are attributable to the stage of infection when parasites reside within erythrocytes. Since these cells are enucleated, they represent an attractive target for host-directed therapeutics, as they may be less likely to develop resistance. Population genetic studies support the idea that host factors can modulate the severity of malaria infections, but we have limited knowledge of the identity of such factors.
We have designed an RNAi-based genetic screen to discover host factors required for invasion or growth of P. falciparum in erythrocytes. Our primary screen has identified ~10% of the erythrocyte proteome as candidates that may influence malaria pathogenesis.

PROJECT NARRATIVE: Plasmodium falciparum malaria is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among children globally, responsible for over 600,000 deaths per year. Drug resistance hampers the effectiveness of parasite-directed antimalarial drugs currently in clinical use;an alternative approach is to target host proteins essential for malaria infection. Here, host proteins required for P. falciparum replication in erythrocytes will be identified using a genetic screen and characterized in terms of their roles in the host-parasite interaction. The results of this work will ultimately guide the rational development of host-targeted therapeutics for malaria.

The national malaria control programme (NMCP) urgently needs to switch to application of insecticides with a different mode of action, i.e. carbamates or organophosphates, as alternatives or supplements to pyrethroids. However resistance to carbamates, the more favoured alternative, has been documented in Ghana, necessitating extremely careful application of insecticide to manage the development and spread of resistance.
To achieve this objective, data are required on how best to predict the dynamics of carbamate resistance. This is the primary goal addressed by the current project. The goal will be achieved via determination of how geographical variation in resistance to carbamates (and to a more limited extent organophosphates) relates to, and can be predicted, by gene flow, assesed using neutral microsatellite markers, and a strongly resistance-linked mutation ace-1R. Since the predictive value of ace-1R frequencies could be compromised if alleles have independent origins, the project will also conduct long range haplotype analysis both to determine mutational origins and to quantify the strength of selection acting on ace-1R.

Improving the design and analysis of drug efficacy/effectiveness studies in malaria and in selected neglected tropical diseases (NTDs).,http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/project/E091C61F-69D2-418D-9585-A3864CC97C44,Project,Nov-14,Oct-17,,$505 243,"Medical Research Council (MRC), UK",,,Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM),Ian Michael Hastings,,"Infectious tropical diseases place an enormous burden on many human populations. The vast majority of such infections can be successfully treated and/or controlled by drugs so the continued provision of effective drugs is an essential component of medical provision in these settings. Such studies often take place in areas where mobile human populations and poor infrastructure mean that patient follow-up is challenging and often incomplete, and where high re-infection rates often obscure successful treatment outcomes. We argue that current methods of measuring drug efficacy/effectiveness in these settings could clearly be improved in a number of areas. We start by investigating an important paradigm species, falciparum malaria, which is one of the 'big three' infective killers, and then move onto the so-called 'neglected tropical diseases' with initial emphasis on shistosomes (a 'worm' infection spread by contact with water containing the snail intermediate hosts). We also consider how information on drug efficacy/effectiveness can be obtained from studies outside of formal drug clinical trials, such such as intermittent treatment programmes.
Technical Summary
We shall investigate how accurately drug efficacy and effectiveness are measured in human tropical infectious diseases. The main methodological challenges are high levels of patient drop-out during follow-up after treatment, and high re-infection rates which mean that drug failures must be distinguished from new infections. We first investigate malaria as an important paradigm disease and then move on to other neglected tropical diseases (NTDs).
The basic technique will be to simulate field data appropriate for each disease and local epidemiological setting using our existing expertise in malaria drug treatment modelling and existing epidemiological models of NTDs. Drug efficacy/effectiveness can then be assessed using existing methods and compared to novel frequentist and Bayesian methods to be developed in the project. We can then address an equally important second question: are existing data collection protocols optimal, or could they be significantly improved? Specifically, how should the number of patients enrolled be balanced against intensity of drug follow-up, and would enrolling more patients with a less frequent, 'sparse' follow-up schedule provide better data while minimising the onus on individual patients for frequent and inconvenient follow up visits? We then consider how drug effectiveness can be monitored using data generated outside of standard clinical trials by following patients taking drugs either prescribed as standard first-line therapies, or administered during intermittent treatment programmes.

Defining the targets of broad intervention antimalarial agents,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8720684,Project,Aug-13,Jul-17,,$1 300 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,"University of California, San Diego (UCSD)",Elizabeth A. Winzeler,,"Although phenotypic cellular screening has recently been used to drive antimalarial drug discovery, there continues to be a clear need for rational target-based drug discovery. This is especially true when appropriate high-throughput cellular assays are lacking. Such is the case for drug discovery efforts that aim to provide a replacement for primaquine, a drug with known toxicity that is the only agent that eliminates Plasmodium vivax liver stage infection and blocks gametocyte transmission.
At present, there are no known chemically validated parasite protein targets that are critical to replicating or hypnozoite liver stages as well as asexual blood and gametocyte stages, and that could be used in biochemical screens of large compound libraries. The genomes of Plasmodium parasite species encode over 5,500 proteins, many of which remain uncharacterized.
Our central hypothesis is that a wealth of novel, chemically validated multi-stage antimalarial targets still remain to be discovered. To test this we propose to focus on five recently discovered, chemically distinct scaffolds with broad ranging activity against the parasite lifecycle, including liver and asexual blood stages. We will further prioritize compounds by determining which of these are active against P. falciparum asexual blood stages from multidrug-resistant strains, gametocytes, and P. vivax hepatic forms.
To generate low-level resistance, we will expose P. falciparum parasites (three independent selections, against three members of each scaffold series) to sublethal concentrations of compound. The genomes of drug-resistant clones will be examined by next-generation sequencing with paired-end reads (yielding ~100X coverage) to identify the complete suite of genetic changes that have emerged in each clone during chemical selection. Based on our preliminary data, we expect to find a statistically significant enrichment of newly emerged mutations in only one gene for each scaffold, when considering the whole-genome sequence for all nine resistant strains created per scaffold family. The importance of the candidate targets wil be verified by introducing genetic changes into drug-sensitive P. falciparum parasites and testing for gain of resistance, or conversely removing candidate mutations and testing for loss of resistance. Transfection experiments will include zinc finger nucleases, which constitute a major breakthrough in their ability to mediate highly efficient gene editing in P. falciparum.
We will alo seek to determine whether the identified gene is the target of the small molecule or a gene involved in resistance through a detailed molecular characterization. The work will provide the malaria community with a systematic picture of how P. falciparum acquires drug resistance, and is expected to yield several new validated targets that can be used in drug development efforts focused on finding new radical-cure agents.
This research, which is consistent with NIAID's mission statement, promises to leverage chemical scaffolds active against Plasmodium parasites to define new targets for the development of broad intervention strategies based on chemoprophylaxis and curative treatment of malarial infections.

Pharmacological modelling and data analysis in decision support of antimalarial drug dosing regimens,http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/project/7DE0B378-DB37-4864-BA19-DD3877A3BA5F,Project,Nov-11,Oct-14,,$623 043,"Medical Research Council (MRC), UK",,,Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM),Ian Michael Hastings,,"Successful treatment of an individual infected with malaria means that the drug resolves their symptoms and clears all parasites from their blood without causing side effects that harm the patient or make them hesitant to use the drug in the future. Treatment success at population level means that the drug is effective and safe, develops a good reputation that optimises patient compliance, reduces malaria transmission from treated patients, reduces the likelihood of new drug resistant mutations arising, and slows the rate of spread of any existing resistant parasites. A clear, explicit methodology is needed to design and optimise dosing regimens to achieve these aims.
Treatment outcome rests on a complex variety of factors, including natural variability in how patients processes the drug (PK), variation in parasite sensitivity to the drug (PD) and variation in patient drug intake depending on their weight, age or height, and patient compliance. Recent developments have resulted in increasingly powerful and accurate simulation models for malaria which has allowed us to simulate drug treatment more accurately. As these models mature it is increasingly recognised that an integrated modelling method that combines different sources of data will help support the development of optimal drug combinations and dosing regimens for new and currently implemented antimalarial drugs.
We have been developing and refining simulation models of antimalarial drug treatment as one of the partners of a large malaria modelling research consortium, OpenMalaria, to the state that they can now successfully capture the broad patterns of variation in treatment outcome noted in real-life. We now propose to further refine and calibrate this methodology, and specifically develop them to combine data from several field and clinical sources to address operational questions surrounding deployment of the latest generation of antimalarial drugs, the artemisinin-combination therapies (ACTs). We do this with a team of experts that range in expertise from modelling, pharmacology, clinical and policy knowledge on antimalarials to ensure that the models are developed according to the needs of drug developers and policy makers.
Technical Summary
Antimalarial drug treatment failures have a complicated aetiology associated with a range of factors, including human pharmacokinetic variation, parasites variation in drug sensitivity, dosing regimens and adherence, and variability caused by dosing patients based on weight/age bands. It is increasingly recognized that models which incorporate these sources of variation have the potential to support and guide the drug implementation process through identification of a drug's future therapeutic potential.
Over the past two years, scientists at LSTM have made good progress in this area. As one of the partners of a large malaria modelling research consortium, Dr Hastings has been developing and refining pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) models of antimalarial drug treatment to the state that they can now successfully capture the broad quantitative patterns noted in the field and clinic. Similarly, Dr Terlouw has led the development of weight-for-age reference curves that are representative of patient populations in the endemic areas of Africa, Asia and Latin America, and has used this to identify optimal age-based dosing regimens, and the associated level of under and overdosing at population level.
We propose to further refine, integrate and calibrate the two research agendas to generate a tool that can address operational questions surrounding deployment of the latest generation of antimalarial drugs, the artemisinin-combination therapies (ACTs). Specifically we propose: (i) We shall incorporate drug absorption and conversion phases; these are important determinants of peak, possible toxic, drug concentrations and occur on important timescales for short half-life artemisinins. (ii) Malaria parasites are insensitive to drugs in certain stages of their lifecycle, and may even enter ?dormant? stages that are unaffected by drugs; we shall develop a methodology to allow for these stages of insensitivity. (iii) We shall develop methodologies to optimise the design of age/height dosing bands. (iv) We shall explicitly calibrate PK/PD variation for the current generation of antimalarial drugs (the ACTs) to investigate the dynamics of drug resistance.
Placing these factors in an explicit PK/PD framework s constitutes a significant advance on current modelling strategies for antimalarial drugs and has the potential to guide and optimise several key aspects of antimalarial deployment in resource-poor settings.

Developing and refining methods of analysing malaria genetic data obtained from infected human blood samples.,http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/project/DBE3B79B-2957-4A4D-A78C-E8A64CEB7127,Project,May-13,May-16,,$526 205,"Medical Research Council (MRC), UK",,,Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM),Ian Michael Hastings,,"The spread of drug resistant malaria is a potent threat to human health in much of the developing world. Resistance can be tracked and quantified provided we know the mutations responsible for resistance (true in many cases) and these data form the basis for many key genetic surveillance programmes aimed at ensuring the continued provision of effective drugs.
The requisite malaria genetic data can, in principle, be obtained from analysing infected human blood samples but people are often simultaneously infected by several malaria clones and this makes it impossible to clearly identify the genetic composition of any single clone.
We propose a program of research to develop and refine suitable methodologies that can overcome these problems of data interpretation allowing good quality genetic data on the frequency of drug resistance to inform public health policy. These methods of analysis also have more general application in understanding the genetic epidemiology of malaria transmission.
Technical Summary
The easiest method of obtaining malaria genetic data from natural transmission settings is by genotyping infected human blood samples. There are two major methodological issues in analysing these data. Firstly, we can only identify alleles as being present or absent in the blood sample so that, for example, if a blood sample contains 5 malaria clones and both wildtype and mutant alleles are detected at a locus, it is impossible to discern if that human infection contains 1,2,3 or 4 mutant clones; this precludes estimating population allele frequencies by simple counting.
The second problem is that we may detect several alleles at different genetic positions in the same blood sample but we cannot always recover the individual malaria multi-locus haplotypes. These issues become extremely important when trying to assess the level of drug resistance in the malaria populations but have more general application in understanding the genetic epidemiology of malaria transmission.
We have developed maximum likelihood (ML) methods to infer allele and haplotype frequencies from infected blood samples but these need to be updated to reflect different assumptions about malaria genetic epidemiology (for example, the possibility of co-transmission of genetically-related clones), to reflect differences in data structure (for example, the number of clones in a human blood sample, the MOI, may not be reported), and to reflect differing assay sensitivities and the presence of genotyping errors in the field datasets. We will address these issues by extending the ML approach and developing a parallel Bayesian approach.

Pyrethroid resistance threatens to compromise the gains made in reducing malaria from large-scale distribution of long-lasting insecticide treated nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) [8]. The pyrethroid resistance mutations, commonly referred to as knockdown resistance or kdr (L1014F/L1014S) are extending th eir range, and in the case of L1014F, approach fixation over much of West Africa.
A secondary mutation, N1575Y, was recently detected at low but rising frequencies in Burkina Faso suggesting an ongoing selective sweep [5]. The resistant haplotype provided added benefit to mosquitoes exposed to pyrethroids/DDT (odds ratios = 1.93 2.60). The discovery of a new resistance mechanism while at a relatively low frequency is a unique opportunity to address some of the key questions in our understanding of resistance management strategies while providing important information for vector control operations within the local setting.
The project will tackle these questions by estimating the selection of N1575Y over the past 20 years; investigating potential sources of selection pressures and exploring the fitness costs associated with kdr haplotypes.

The international community has now recognised that if suitable resistance management strategies to preserve the efficacy of current insecticides are not developed, this resistance will have devastating public health consequences. Unfortunately, important knowledge gaps on resistance (molecular basis, evolution and fitness cost) and the lack of adequate molecular tools to track resistance are preventing the design and implementation of suitable resistance mitigation strategies.
To fill these gaps, I aim in this project to improve the control of An. funestus Africa-wide, by detecting molecular markers to track resistance, by elucidating patterns of evolution and spread of resistance and assessing the fitness cost of resistance and its impact on control interventions.

To establish molecular markers and user-friendly diagnostic assays for pyrethroid, DDT and carbamate resistance and cross-resistance in An. funestus Africa-wide using Next-Generation Sequencing and functional analyses.
To predict the evolution and spread of resistance by defining patterns of gene flow and selective sweeps in field populations.

Massue,,"Insecticide resistance is genotypes in mosquito populations confer heritable phenotypes that are either physiological (suppressed penetration, molecular target site sensitivity, or altered detoxification/activation rates) or behavioural (avoidance by biting/resting outdoors).
When such traits are selected for in malaria vector mosquito populations, they threaten the effectiveness of the most important scaleable intervention options available in Africa today: insecticide-treated nets and indoor residual spraying.
Although standard bioassays measure physiological forms of resistance they may fail to detect mild resistance traits which are important under normal field conditions where exposure to treated surface is transitory. Furthermore, such bioassays cannot capture behavioural resistance, even though this may well be the most immediate and important form of resistance occurring in Tanzania and elsewhere in Africa.
My goals are therefore as follows:
1. Develop field-based methodologies which enable national programmes to monitor and evaluate all forms of insecticide resistance.
2. Demonstrate that these assays reveal the emergence of resistance traits which cannot otherwise be detected and enable estimation of their epidemiological impact.
3. Enable rational planning of integrated vector management programmes that effectively control transmission by resistant vectors, particularly those which competitively replace historically dominant species at high coverage with insecticide-treated nets and indoor residual spraying.

However, the cellular mechanisms determining the nature of antibody responses in P. falciparum infection are not understood.

The control of malaria in pregnancy in Indonesia, where approximately 10% of pregnant women get infected with malaria, could receive a potential boost through a new study conducted by the Eijkman Institute for Molecular Biology and the Timika Research Facility in Indonesia. Together with experts from the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine in the UK, they are going to test two new methods of preventing malaria and the harmful effects in pregnancy.
When pregnant women contract malaria this can have devastating consequences for pregnancy, resulting in fever which may trigger preterm onset of labour or even pregnancy loss. It is also possible for women to be infected without showing any outward signs or symptoms, yet if these infections are undetected and left untreated, they can cause anaemia in the mother and can interfere with the growth of the fetus leading to low birth weight, which increases the risk of babies dying during infancy.
The new project will provide malaria testing to women with or without the symptoms of malaria on every scheduled antenatal visit using a rapid diagnostic test (RDT). The RDT is simple to perform, uses a single drop of blood and gives results within 15 minutes. Those women testing positive will be treated with an artemisinin combination drug called dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHP), which is the treatment of choice in the 2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy in Indonesia. A second method called intermittent preventive treatment, which is used in most countries in Africa but not yet in Asia, will also be tested. With this method women without symptoms of malaria will be selected to receive the same drug but without prior blood testing.
Both methods will be compared with the existing policy in Indonesia, where all pregnant women are tested for malaria on the first antenatal visit only, and those with a positive result are treated with DHP. During subsequent antenatal visits, women are only tested if they have symptoms of malaria such as fever. This means that some infections will go undetected. It is anticipated that the two new methods will either detect infections much earlier than the current approach, or prevent them altogether.
The findings of this study, together with an assessment of feasibility and cost effectiveness of each method, will be used to inform malaria prevention policy for pregnant women in Indonesia and other parts of South East Asia.
Technical Summary
BACKGROUND:
Malaria in Pregnancy (MiP) can have devastating consequences to mother and newborn, yet the harmful effects are entirely preventable. Annually, 70% of 125.2 million pregnancies in malaria endemic regions occur in the Asia-Pacific region, and cost-effective prevention strategies are urgently needed in this region which has predominantly low-intensity falciparum and vivax transmission. Indonesia is the first country in Asia to introduce systematic screening at first antenatal visit (Single Screening and Treatment: SSTp). SSTp may not detect subsequent infections. A proposed extension is intermittent screening and treatment (ISTp) consisting of repeated screening with rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) as part of focused antenatal care and treating the RDT positive women with long-acting drugs that also provides several weeks of post-treatment prophylaxis. Screening strategies however may miss low density PCR-positive infections, not detectable by RDT or microscopy. Recently completed surveys in Asia have shown an unexpectedly high prevalence of these infections in asymptomatic pregnant women. Under these circumstances, intermittent preventive therapy (IPTp) is another approach, not yet evaluated in Asia though widely used in sub-Saharan Africa.
OBJECTIVES AND METHODS:
Open-label three-arm parallel-group multicentre cluster-randomised controlled superiority trial conducted in two rural sites in Eastern Indonesia comparing the efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of IPTp and ISTp with the current SSTp strategy. Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine will be used in all three arms. The study is designed to detect 50% reduction in malaria infection at birth from 10% to 5%; Unit of randomization: antenatal clinics. Sample size: 23 clusters of 41 women per arm (N=3198) (Power 90%, alpha 0.025, ICC 0.002, allowing for 20% loss-to-follow-up and 13% efficiency loss due to varying cluster sizes). Secondary endpoints include clinical malaria, maternal anaemia, preterm birth, low birthweight and safety endpoints. Enrolled women of all parities in the 2nd trimester make 3 or 4 scheduled ANC visits 6-8 weeks apart. Infant follow-up is 42 days. Sub-studies of the cost-effectiveness, acceptability/feasibility studies will be conducted alongside the main clinical trial.
PARTNERS AND PRODUCT:
The project builds on an existing MiP research collaborations between the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (trial sponsor), the Eijkman Institute in Jakarta (coordinating Institute) and between the Timika Research Facility in Indonesia, and the Menzies School of Health Research, Australia and is designed to inform national, regional and global policy. It is designed in close collaboration with the policy makers and main implementers in Indonesia, notably the MoH, WHO and UNICEF-Indonesia.
The project will take 3.5 years.

This heterogeneity is reflected in important differences in the epidemiology of the disease. In urban areas, transmission is usually low compared to rural areas.However, in Cameroon, the rapid and unplanned urbanisation deriving from the migration of populations from rural to urban areas, have profoundly influenced malaria epidemiology in the two largest cities of the country.
As anopheline mosquitoes adapt to the polluted envi ronment of the cities malaria transmission may increase. The effect of this adaptation on the Anopheles tolerance to insecticides used in malaria control is unknown. A detailed knowledge of the biology of urban malaria vectors, including the processes and mechanisms by which these vectors adapt to pollutants as well as to the many insecticides is needed to plan and implement urban malaria control strategies.
Our objective is to investigate factors facilitating the vectors adaptation to urban se tting in view to develop an integrated vector control strategy to successfully control malaria in urban settings.

Modular Chimeric Vaccines tailored for malaria parasites,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=7900058,Project,Aug-06,Jul-12,,$2 000 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,Emory University,Alberto Moreno,,"The overall goal of this research proposal is to optimize the design, composition and formulation of malaria Modular Chimeric Vaccines (MCVs) as effective intervention measures to control the disease in endemic areas. MCVs are synthetic genes designed to express an array of protective antigens derived from several proteins and a number of Plasmodium universal T cell epitopes. Malaria universal T cell epitopes will promote helper T-cell responses, overcome the genetic restriction associated with several malaria antigens and facilitate the boosting effect induced by natural exposure to malaria parasites. 
MCVs will be designed in silico using computer-assisted algorithms to predict molecular conformation and stability characteristics and to induce immune responses to several stages of the parasite life cycle. The amino acid sequences of these chimeric constructs will be reverse translated, codon optimized and assembled into synthetic genes. The synthetic genes will be cloned, inserted into E. coli, and the proteins expressed and purified. These antigens will be assessed for molecular stability and antigenicity, and then tested for immunogenicity and protection. 
The first specific aim will focus on developing strategies to construct and deliver stable and efficacious MCVs that can protect rhesus macaques against the experimental challenge with a simian malaria parasite Plasmodium cynomolgi. This parasite reproduces in rhesus monkeys several clinical features of the infection of humans with P. vivax. 
The second aim of the project will build on the experience gained to design MCVs with the potential to protect humans against P. vivax. These P. vivax MCVs will be tested for immunogenicity and protection in Aotus monkeys, a non-human primate model considered the gold standard for testing malaria vaccine candidates. Our rigorous evaluation of MCVs in stringent models of protection will provide critical data to advance the development of this vaccine platform for use in clinical trials.
Relevance. Malaria caused by P. vivax is a major worldwide health problem with an estimated 80 million cases annually. Outside Africa, P. vivax is the most widely distributed malaria parasite. P. vivax malaria is resurging and now represents a serious threat in areas where it had been eradicated. The emergence of P. vivax chloroquine and primaquine drug resistant strains has brought increased emphasis to the need for alternative prophylactic and therapeutic strategies to control this infection.

Development of a P. vivax immunization and sporozoite challenge model for human,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8081043,Project,Jun-08,May-14,,$1 200 000,"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), US",,,"Malaria Vaccine and Drug Development Center (MVDC), Colombia",Socrates Herrera-Valencia,,"Vaccination with malaria irradiated sporozoites (irr-spz) represents one of the most promising means to prevent the development of pre-erythrocytic stages of human Plasmodia and therefore of preventing malaria disease. Studies conducted in human and animal models have reproducibly demonstrated that this vaccination strategy consistently induces solid sterile protection. 
The purpose of this research is to standardize a Plasmodium vivax irr-spz vaccine model in human volunteers. This general objective will be approached by addressing the following specific aims: 1) To conduct proof- of-principle studies on the protective efficacy of P. vivax irr spz vaccination in human volunteers;and 2) To evaluate the immune responses in all study participants and search for immune correlates of protection. 
Studies will involve P. vivax-infected individuals serving as parasite donors and both Duffy+ (Fy+) and Fy- healthy volunteers that will be serially immunized (10-15 times) with irradiated or non- irradiated P. vivax infected mosquitoes. A total of 24 malaria naive volunteers will be allocated to four groups (A-D) of six volunteers each. Group A (Fy+) and group B (Fy-) volunteers will be vaccinated with irr- spz. Group C (Fy- volunteers) will be vaccinated with live spz. After the vaccination protocol is completed, all volunteers, including a control group D (not vaccinated) will be challenged by the bite of infected mosquitoes. Volunteers will be closely followed and development of patent infection will be assessed by thick blood smear to assess the protective efficacy of the vaccination. Infected volunteers will be immediately treated with standard antimalarial therapy. 
Specific immune response to P. vivax pre-erythrocytic antigens including whole parasites will be studied by measuring B cell, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses as well as Th1/Th2 cytokine production. Reagents (sera/cells) collected during this study will be used to screen for novel genes/antigens with potential for vaccine development. Immunological analyses are expected to allow the identification of immune correlates of protection. 
The proposed experiments will be performed at the Malaria Vaccine and Drug Development Center (MVDC) in Colombia, with support from US and European collaborators. The participating teams combine unique capabilities and physical facilities for the conduct of the proposed clinical trial and immunological studies as well as to contribute to the development of a P. vivax malaria vaccine. 
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Vaccines represent the most cost-effective measure to control transmissible diseases. Therefore, a malaria vaccine that prevents parasite transmission from mosquito to human or its development in human beings would become a valuable tool to avoid malaria in travelers and in individuals living in endemic regions, estimated to be 2.5 billion exposed humans.

Plasmodium vivax is associated with 70-80 million clinical cases of malaria reported each year, with 2.6 billion people at risk of infection worldwide. 
Institutions based in two P. vivax-endemic countries, Brazil and Sri Lanka, are partnering with leading research groups in the USA to address the following specific research aims: 1) To estimate levels of microsatellite diversity, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) density and recombination rates and to examine the geographic structure of worldwide populations of P. vivax; 2) To examine the transmission dynamics of genetically distinct P. vivax strains in a well-characterized cohort of malaria-exposed subjects and determine the rate at which new haplotypes are introduced or disappear in the population; 3) To carry out SNP and microsatellite discovery across a 300-kb chromosome segment of four representative strains of P. vivax and to standardize high-throughput strategies for large-scale typing of these SNPs in field isolates; 4) To compare these 300-kb of DNA sequence of P. vivax with the corresponding sequence in one of its closest relatives, the monkey malaria parasite P. knowlesi, to obtain estimates of single-nucleotide mutation rates and SNP density for various types of DNA sequence (microsatellite repeats vs. complex sequences, coding vs. noncoding DNA) of P. vivax and to allow the identification of genes under positive selection across this chromosome segment. 
This in-depth analysis of the mechanisms that create and maintain genetic variation in this human malaria parasite will provide crucial information to predict how fast novel phenotypes of public health importance, such as drug resistance and new antigenic variants, originate and spread in natural populations of P. vivax. In addition, the estimates of recombination rates in different parasite populations, to be generated by the chromosome-wide analysis of informative microsatellite and SNP loci in field-collected isolates, facilitate the design of genome-wide association mapping studies to identify genes that are responsible for important parasite traits in diverse epidemiological settings.

Host immune response to malaria infection,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=7817465,Project,Sep-10,Sep-12,,$500 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,Yeshiva University,Johanna Patricia Daily,,"This application addresses Broad Challenge area (04) Clinical research and Specific Challenge topic, (AI-102) the human immune response to infection and immunization-profiling via modern immunological and systems biology. Malaria remains a major source of morbidity and mortality in many countries. Fundamental questions such as the mechanisms of immunity, the role of the immune system in cerebral disease and the mechanism of loss of malaria immunity in HIV infected adults remain poorly understood. 
The clinical relevance of these issues is extremely high. Patients that develop cerebral malaria have a 15% mortality rate despite potent antimalarials. HIV has resulted in hundreds of thousands of additional symptomatic infections in adults who previously were immune. Understanding mechanisms of cerebral malaria and protection mediated by the immune system will guide interventions to improve survival rates and lessen HIV related malaria. The lack of understanding of the immune systems role in these clinical scenarios is in part due to a lack of comprehensive analysis of the immune response in natural cohorts. We propose to carry out immune profiling through new methods of whole genome transcription in malaria infected patients to provide an unbiased view of immune response in malaria infection. 
This analysis will be carried out in two phenotypically highly characterized cohorts 1) children with cerebral malaria 2) adults with HIV/malaria co-infection. There is prior evidence to suggest that a deregulated, pro-inflammatory immune response is the mechanism that gives rise to cerebral malaria. 
Specific Aim I will address this hypothesis through whole genome transcriptional profiling in a cerebral malaria disease cohort. Through an ongoing study of cerebral malaria, peripheral blood aliquots are available to analyze host transcriptional responses. Comparison of whole genome transcriptional responses to other datasets including mild malaria and systemic inflammatory syndrome will be carried out. We will develop a prediction model for survivors vs. non survivors of cerebral malaria with the goal of developing biomarkers that can be used in patient care. 
Our second specific aim is based on the clinical observation that HIV infected adults lose their natural immunity to malaria disease. Typically immune adults are frequently infected but have no physical symptoms or laboratory abnormalities. HIV infected patients have an increase in the risk of asymptomatic parasitemia, symptomatic malaria and more severe disease;this increase is inversely proportional to CD4+ T cell count. The basis of this loss of immunity is unknown. Through the analysis of a second cohort, we will characterize the immune response to malaria in HIV negative and HIV positive adults. Using biostatistical and computational analysis we will identify the genes and biological pathways that have altered expression based on CD4+T cell counts. 
These studies may provide insight into components of protective immunity in malaria. Conversely we will further understand how HIV impacts patients' immune response to malaria which may inform studies of HIV and other pathogens. All datasets will be compared to previously published relevant transcriptional host response profiling using systems biology and computational biology approaches to develop broader models of immune response to pathogens. 
This study brings together two components that are critical for high impact, high quality clinical research. The first is the clinical expertise in the disease and the experience and cohorts to carry out high quality field research in malaria and HIV. The second is the experience and creativity of the analysis team which include epidemiologists, biostatisticians and computational biologists. This proposal has brought together an outstanding team with these skills to provide high impact results to inform pathogenesis models and vaccine/drug development in malaria.

Genetic diversity in the parasite is likely to be a major determinant for many of the adaptive changes in parasite populations. Understanding the frequency and distribution of polymorphisms in the extant parasite population is essential for the development of genetic mapping tools that can provide a powerful approach to identify genetic loci responsible for important phenotypes such as drug resistance.
The human haplotype map (HapMap) project has pioneered the way for systematic, genome-wide scans for the detection of chromosomal regions associated with virtually any kind of complex trait, including the identification of genes likely evolving under positive or balancing selection. As the human HapMap was in its final stages, we began working with collaborators at the Broad Institute to ascertain SNPs (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) across the genome of P. falciparum, using similar intense efforts to monitor and establish high quality data as those employed in the human HapMap.
The rationale was to produce community resources that could be used for genetic association studies in P. falciparum, encouraged by the great utility of smaller scale studies by others that identified the genes responsible for chloroquine and pyrimethamine resistance. The SNP discovery phase has recently been completed and a robust genotyping tool has been developed.
","The objectives of this study are to use the SNP database to genotype world-wide isolates of P. falciparum in order to perform a proof-of-principle validation of association studies to identify genetic determinants of drug resistance.

Dscam function in innate immunity,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8655828,Project,Jun-10,May-15,,$1 600 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,Johns Hopkins University,George Dimopoulos,,"Anopheles gambiae and other insects utilize a variety of strategies to combat microbial invaders. The long-term goal of the PIs research is to characterize and understand the mechanisms of innate immunity used by the mosquito against microbes. 
This proposal focuses on the particular role of the Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam) as a hypervariable immune surveillance receptor. Dscam's complex genomic organization and remarkable properties suggest that it plays multiple roles in immune defense: In A. gambiae, alternative splicing of the AgDscam gene produces >31,920 alternative splice- form receptors with different adhesive characteristics and specificities. AgDscam produces microbe-specific splice-form repertoires upon immune challenge and is involved in both antibacterial and anti-Plasmodium defense. 
The studies outlined here will further test the hypothesis that, as previously shown for challenge with a limited number of bacteria, this phenotypic plasticity of the AgDscam gene allows it to produce receptor molecules with potent antimicrobial activity and high affinity for bacteria and the Plasmodium parasite. 
To test this hypothesis, the proposed studies will use RNAi silencing, immunohistochemical staining, microarray analyses, and interaction analyses to determine (in Specific Aim 1) the regulation of AgDscam splicing and production of splice form repertoire by microbe challenge and the innate immune pathways, and (in Aims 2) the specific splice-form repertoires involved in these defenses and interactions with microbes. We will finally test the anti-Plasmodium defense specificity and efficacy of AgDscam in genetically modified mosquito lines that over-express pathogen specific splice forms (in Specific Aim 3). 
These analyses will elucidate one of the most remarkable players of the insect innate immune system, which allows it to cope with a broad spectrum of microbes through the microbe challenge specific production of pattern recognition receptors. The study will also assess the feasibility to use AgDscam for the generation of Plasmodium resistant mosquitoes that could be used for the development of a malaria control strategy. 
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Anopheles mosquito uses its innate immune system to fight against a broad spectrum of microbial pathogens including the Plasmodium parasite.

This knowledge will identify and characterize proteins that may serve as important vivax malaria vaccine candidates or targets of anti-malaria drug interventions. 
Plasmodium vivax is a highly predominant malaria species, causing 80 million cases or more of malaria each year and major socioeconomic public health ramifications worldwide. Nevertheless, P. vivax is under investigated in part because it cannot be cultured reliably long term in vitro. Specialized expertise and non human primate resources are therefore required for in depth laboratory investigations on this human parasite species. Experimental models using P. vivax parasites and the related simian malaria species P. knowlesi and P. cynomolgi in non-human primates are fundamental to this research program. Plasmodium merozoites are very complex and there are many gaps in knowledge regarding the full scope of molecules involved in their adhesion to and entry into red blood cells. 
The specific aims of this research are to 1) Identify novel P. vivax genes encoding merozoite proteins with surface, organellar and apical locations, 2) Investigate structural and functional characteristics of P. vivax merozoite surface and apically localized proteins and protein complexes, and 3) Develop a P. vivax model for integrated transfection and reverse genetics investigations. 
This research capitalizes extensively on the recent availability of Plasmodium genome databases, utilizing bioinformatics, micro-arrays, proteomics, genetic manipulation strategies, high resolution imaging capabilities, functional adhesion and invasion assays, immunochemical methods and cell biological technologies. This research will reveal new P. vivax merozoite proteins, gain a fuller understanding of the structure and coordinated expression of specific merozoite proteins and develop new knowledge on protein complexes, post translational modifications and function. 
As priorities, this project will also provide reagents for the broader malaria research community and develop a P. vivax blood-stage transcriptome and merozoite proteome, which will be valuable for vivax research specifically, as well as comparative genomics research aimed to distinguish features that are distinctive to the biology of P. vivax or conserved among Plasmodium parasites. 
Project Narrative Plasmodium vivax is a major species of malaria, which causes an estimated 80 million or greater infections annually in about 60 countries.

However, rising insecticide resistance and increased outdoor transmission have greatly hampered the effectiveness of ITN and IRS because the current indoor-based interventions do not target the outdoor-biting mosquitoes. Consequently, most highland sites maintain sustained low- level transmission while some others have recently experienced resurgence in malaria rates. Therefore, new supplemental interventions that can tackle outdoor transmission and pyrethroid insecticide resistance are urgently needed. 
The central objective of this competing renewal application is to determine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of EPA-approved long-lasting microbial larvicides in reducing malaria transmission and clinical malaria incidence in western Kenya highlands. The three specific aims are: 1) to examine mechanisms regulating larval habitat productivity, 2) to determine the efficacy of long-lasting microbial larvicides on the reduction of malaria transmission and clinical malaria incidence using a cluster randomized study, and 3) to determine the cost-effectiveness of the long-lasting microbial larviciding program as compared to other malaria control interventions and evaluate its impact on non-target organisms. 
Through comprehensive evaluation of potentially cost-effective long-lasting microbial larvicides, this project will provide critically needed data on whether long-lasting microbial larvicides can be scaled up as a supplemental malaria control tool to further reduce malaria incidence in African highlands. Malaria outdoor transmission control is presently a highly significant and urgent issue in malaria control across Africa, and thus, our results will have broad implications on malaria prevention and control in endemic and epidemic regions of Africa.

Fetal Immunity of Malaria,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8689882,Project,Jul-05,Jun-16,,$3 300 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,Case Western Reserve University,Christopher L. King,,"Transplacental transfer of antigens from mother to fetus often occurs producing a fetal immune response in some cases or fetal immune tolerance in others. In developing countries, transplacental antigen transfer is especially common, since pregnant women are often affected by one or more chronic infections. How transplacental transfer occurs, the nature and variety of the fetal responses generated, and the impact of prenatal exposure on subsequent childhood immunity remain poorly understood. 
Greater understanding of these fetal immune responses has broad applications in a host of areas, most especially maternal-fetal medicine and neonatal care. Prenatal exposure to exogenous antigens may affect maturation and possible ""imprinting"" of both innate and adaptive immune responses in early life and such early exposure to infectious agents or antigens can be beneficial or detrimental. 
In malaria in pregnancy, parasitized erythrocytes (irbc) sequester in the placenta and irbcs or their soluble products cross the placenta during gestation, either priming or tolerizing the fetal immune response. In those newborns who demonstrate immune tolerance, we have shown increased susceptibility to falciparum malaria infection up to 3 years of age. Whether this tolerance affects susceptibility to falciparum or vivax malaria illness throughout childhood is not known. Also unclear is why only some newborns acquire the tolerant phenotype. The immunologic mechanisms mediating this tolerance are poorly understood. Increasing evidence supports the hypothesis that acquired immune tolerance is an active form of immune suppression, rather than a passive functional defect occurring during fetal development and is mediated by regulatory T cells (Tregs). 
Here we hypothesize that prenatal exposure to malaria antigens induces fetal malaria-specific Tregs that persist into childhood, inhibiting protective immune responses that would normally attenuate severity of illness. We further hypothesize that the timing of fetal exposure to malaria antigens determines whether immune tolerance or fetal priming is acquired. 
To test these hypotheses we will take advantage of an ongoing project supported by the Malaria in Pregnancy Consortium, where women will be randomized to receive either intensive malaria prophylaxis throughout pregnancy or standard therapy consisting of one-time prophylaxis. Women between 14 and 26 weeks of gestational age will be recruited, resulting in variable timing of prophylaxis (and thus variable timing of malaria exposure) during gestation.

Molecular Mechanisms of Antigenic Variation in Malaria,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=7800384,Project,May-06,Apr-12,,$2 000 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,Emory University,Mary R. Galinski,,"The broad, long-term objective of this project is to capitalize on the strengths of the P. knowlesi in vivo non- human primate model system to identify, distinguish and characterize the molecular mechanisms that regulate antigenic variation in Plasmodium. Antigenic variation in Plasmodium is a fundamental adaptation to evade a host protective immune response and one of the major factors contributing to the establishment of chronic malaria blood infections and severe pathology. 
As Plasmodium falciparum develops in an infected erythrocyte it produces high molecular weight proteins that become exposed at the surface of these host cells. These protein antigens vary in the course of an immune response by switching the expression of over 50 members of a large gene family, called the SICAvar gene family in P. knowlesi and the var gene family in P. falciparum. The precise genetic and immunobiological mechanisms regulating this process in vivo remain largely unknown, and, to date, speculative at best. The P. knowlesi simian malaria/rhesus monkey model - originally used to discover antigenic variation in malaria - uniquely enables investigations of the mechanisms that operate in vivo as well as in vitro at the DNA, RNA and protein levels as changes in phenotypic expression occur. 
We have demonstrated using proteomic technologies that the surface exposed variant antigens of P. knowlesi, known as the SICA (Schizont Infected Cell Agglutination) antigens, are related to the P. falciparum variant antigens called the Erythrocyte Membrane Protein-1 (EMP1), corroborating earlier biological data in support of these relationships. Importantly, the P. knowlesi model enables the development and investigation of in vivo derived, isogenic related clones exhibiting distinct stable SICA[+] phenotypes;as well as SICA[-] phenotypes after passage in splenectomized animals. These cloned P. knowlesi parasite populations allow for carefully controlled studies related to variant antigen expression, switching, and the in vivo interplay with the host immune response. Using this model system we identified the SICA var gene family and determined that the expression of the 205 kDa SICA antigen in Pk1(B+)1 + parasites is the result of a specific recombination event involving conserved yet polymorphic 3'coding and non-coding sequences. 
The specific aims of this new project relating to the investigations of mechanisms that regulate antigenic variation in Plasmodium are to: 1) Investigate the hypothesis that specific 3'genomic DNA recombination events, as observed to date, are associated with in vivo switching and activation of SICA var genes, resulting in their transcription and translation, and 2) Investigate RNA characteristics and putative functional traits of expressed and non-expressed SICAvar genes in up to three stable isogenic SICA[+] and SICA[-] clonal parasite lines derived from successive switching events.

This project has three specific aims designed to test hypotheses regarding potential functions for laccases in mosquito physiology and to investigate laccase inhibitors for use in biochemical analyses of laccase function and for testing whether laccases may be a potentially useful new target for chemical control of mosquitoes. 1) Investigate the role of laccases in cuticle sclerotization, pigmentation, wound healing, and egg shell tanning. 2) Determine whether laccases have a role in protecting insects from toxic substances such as phenolic compounds in the larval environment or iron in the blood meal. 3) Design, synthesize, and test inhibitors of Anopheles laccases for exploring the laccase active site and for tests of the inhibitors'effects on mosquito development and survival. 
Relevance: Because they are vectors of human diseases, mosquitoes have a tremendous human health impact, and Anopheles gambiae is particularly important as the major vector of malaria in Africa. Studies of mosquito laccases will increase our understanding of fundamental processes in mosquito biology and may provide knowledge regarding how these insects transmit diseases or how they tolerate toxic chemicals. Disrupting laccase function may provide a new mechanism for controlling mosquito populations.

Development of Antimalarial Preclinical Candidates,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8126349,Project,Aug-07,Jul-13,,$5 400 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,St. Jude Children's Research Hospital ,R. Kiplin Guy,,"The broad, long term goals of this project are to discover multiple new lead compounds that are candidates for the treatment of malaria and to push these compounds as far forward as possible through preclinical studies. The health relatedness of these goals lies in the fact that there are few available drugs to treat malaria and many of those that are available are subject to clinical resistance. In fact, resistance to available drugs has been identified as the primary difficulty in the treatment of malaria. Co-therapy has emerged as the best practical solution to this problem. 
Therefore, the basic logical assumption of this proposal is that the development of multiple drug candidates will enable the suppression of the development of clinical resistance. This program targets two relatively unaddressed target classes: cation channels and kinases. As a back up strategy, the program also targets compounds with the same mechanism of action as existing quinolines. 
The research design and methods for achieving these goals involves the use of parallel medicinal chemistry; in vitro and in vivo measures of compound efficacy; and in vitro and in vivo measures of compound availability, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity. Compounds will be incrementally improved by applying cycles of these methods and refining the model that defines the overall best balance of these traits in a molecule between cycles. Compound series that fail to progress will be abandoned and progression monitored using a milestone driven model with a defined decision matrix for compound progression. 
The specific aims of this program are: 1. Develop five lead series (LO) with divergent chemotypes and presumptive mechanisms of action 2. Simultaneously optimize efficacy against drug resistant P. falciparum in vitro and favorable in vitro cellular and biochemical pharmacological profiles for each series 3. Optimize up to five promising validated lead series (L1, L2) using in vivo rodent efficacy, pharmacokinetic, and toxicology models 4. Optimize up to three promising late stage lead series (L3) using in vivo simian efficacy, pharmacokinetic, and toxicology models 5. Select two preclinical candidates (PO) from these series.

Determinants of growth and fitness in drug resistant malaria parasites,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8206639,Project,Jan-08,Dec-13,,$1 800 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,"University of Notre Dame, USA",Michael T. Ferdig,,"The malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, continues to devastate human health. The emergence and spread of multi-drug resistant (MDR) parasites following decades of over-use of chloroquine (CQ) is of fundamental significance to current malaria control efforts. The near-global selective sweep of the K76T- encoding mutation in the CQ resistance (CQR) gene, pfcrt, left behind an adapted genome impacting parasite growth, fitness, and a propensity for rapid MDR evolution. The long-term goal of this project is to identify the molecular components of this resistance-adapted genome. 
Our hypothesis is that there is an essential genetic background of CQR parasites, comprising networked gene actions that compensate for altered PfCRT function and stabilize parasite physiology and growth in the absence of drug pressure. To detect the genome-wide presence of these drug resistance adaptations, we focus on basic growth and normal cellular processes in two different parasite solutions to historical drug pressure: 1) progeny of a genetic cross that maintain a common pfcrt allele in a segregating CQR/MDR background;2) a spectrum of laboratory-selected pfcrt mutant lines in a single controlled genetic background. Our Specific Aims build upon a detailed analysis of growth and physiological traits in the absence of drug to drive a genome-wide search for the gene networks controlling key parameters of fitness. 
Specific Aim 1. To precisely quantify growth and physiological parameters as indicators of parasite fitness in cultured red blood cells. We will use QTL mapping of these inter- related traits to pinpoint genome regions to facilitate searches for key genes using powerful emerging comparative databases and tools. 
Specific Aim 2. To identify strain-specific shifts in pfcrt-mutant transcription profiles and to map expression (e)QTL controlling inheritance of expression level traits. 
Specific Aim 3. To identify genome structural variants associated with CQ-selection. We will determine copy number polymorphisms in genes known to be associated with drug resistance and use high resolution CGH identification of gene copy number variations, small deletions, and some SNPs throughout the genome. Formal integration of these layers of independent but complimentary whole-genome biological data highlights a novel approach to elucidate new avenues for antimalarial intervention. 
Project Narrative: Malaria kills more than 2 million kids in Africa and infects more than 500 million people worldwide each year. The recently completed /Plasmodium falciparum /comparative genome sequencing project at the Broad Institute provides a vast view of genetic diversity of this species; however, few methods have been developed to use this information. Our proposal uses a combination of classical genetic linkage mapping with new tools to study gene expression variation and chromosomal structural variation around the entire genome. An integration of these tools will facilitate the mapping of the molecular determinants of fitness and virulence in dangerous multi-drug resistant malaria parasites. This knowledge will lead to new avenues of attack against this disease.

"Development of vector-specific, resistance-breaking insecticides to reduce malaria",http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8445236,Project,Apr-09,Sep-15,,$3 400 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,Virginia Tech,Paul R. Carlier,,"Malaria exacts a terrible toll in sub-Saharan Africa, killing an estimated 1-2 million persons each year, mostly children. Pyrethroid-based insecticide treated nets (pyrethroid ITNs) provide the first line of defense against disease transmission, but emerging resistant strains of the disease vector (Anopheles gambiae) threaten to render these ITNs ineffective. 
Our broad objective is to develop a new class of acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-targeting insecticide for deployment on ITNs, that is safe for use, effective against current pyrethroid- and AChE- resistant strains, and is less likely to foster emergence of new AChE-resistant strains. Thus our goal is consistent with the focus of the solicitation on novel interventions for the control of Malaria. FNIH-sponsored research from 2005-2008 enabled us to make significant progress towards our long-term goal. Further support from NIH will allow us to establish proof of concept that our novel AChE-based insecticide, deployed on an ITN, would constitute a superior intervention to manage the disease vector. Thus our goal is also consistent with the stated aim of the solicitation to fund translational research. 
To achieve our goal we have assembled a team of chemists, structural biologists, entomologists, and toxicologists. Our specific aims are to 1)improve stability of An. gambiae AChE (AgAChE)-selective carbamates to oxidative detoxification; 2)acquire 3D structural information on AgAChE to optimize inhibition potency and selectivity; 3)develop bivalent carbamates for resilience to target-site mutation; 4)identify strategies to mitigate against carboxylesterase-mediated detoxification;and 5)make a preliminary assessment of mammalian toxicity of the most promising insecticides to emerge from these studies. 
To guide us through the proposed five years of research we have prepared a detailed timeline and decision tree that incorporate five integrated streams of insecticide discovery for optimizing field performance and human safety. Moreover the built-in complementarity of the chemical synthesis routes and the optimization approaches (e.g. resilience to both target-site and metabolic resistance mechanisms) means that unexpected difficulty in one stream need not slow progress in the other streams. These multiple approaches increase the probability of project success. 
Malaria exacts a terrible toll in sub-Saharan African, and at present the first line of defense against the mosquito vector of the disease is provided by insecticide treated nets (ITNs). However, growing resistance to the class of insecticide used on the nets threatens to make this protection ineffective. We propose to develop a new class of insecticide that is safe for ITN deployment, effective against current insecticide-resistant mosquitoes, and less likely to promote emergence of new resistant strains.

Imaging preerythrocytic Plasmodium stages in naive and immune individuals,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=7849970,Project,Jun-09,Feb-13,,$829 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,New York University (NYU),Ute Frevert,,"The broad, long-term objective of this application is to provide a better understanding of the basic cellular immune mechanisms by which protected individuals and animals control Plasmodium development in the liver. Despite the severe impact of malaria on millions of people, the basic immunobiology of this parasite in the liver, the initial site of replication in the mammalian host, is still poorly understood. 
The ability of malaria-specific effector T cells to successfully target the parasites and eliminate them from the liver has been well established using the attenuated malaria sporozoite vaccine model. This whole organism approach represents the ""gold standard"" for a malaria vaccine, since immunization of rodents, monkeys and humans with radiation-attenuated sporozoites, delivered by intravenous injection or the bite of malaria-infected mosquitoes, was shown to prevent blood infection. 
Understanding which of the possible cellular mechanisms of cytotoxicity provides the highest level of protection may help refine vaccination strategies to induce such responses and improve the chance that more practical vaccines can be found. For example, multivalent subunit vaccines offer numerous advantages including greater safety due to minimized deleterious responses against non-protective determinants, lower production costs, and ease of storage. Ideally, such a vaccine would prevent the 2-3 million malaria deaths worldwide, an estimated 90% of which occur in young children in Africa. 
The Specific Aim is to exploit the recent advances in microscopic imaging to determine how Plasmodium liver stage development and merozoite release can be interrupted in an immune host. Novel imaging techniques and instrumentation, transgenic parasites and mice, highly specific fluorogenic reporter substrates and molecular probes will be used to elucidate, which liver cells are able to present malaria antigen to effector T cells and which cellular effector mechanisms eliminate the parasites from the liver. Direct visualization and molecular analysis of target cell killing, the pinnacle of T cell immunity, will greatly advance our understanding of the adaptive cell-mediated immune response against malaria liver stages.

The Plasmodium 2TM and PHIST protein families,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8296626,Project,Jul-09,Jun-14,,$1 700 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,Cornell University,Thomas J. Templeton ,,"The human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, possesses a broad repertoire of proteins that are proposed to be trafficked to the erythrocyte cytoplasm or surface, based upon the presence within these proteins of a signal peptide followed by a Pexel/HT erythrocyte trafficking motif. This catalog includes two large families of proteins that are the subject of this proposal: the predicted 2 transmembrane (2TM) proteins that likely function within the erythrocyte membrane, including the RIFIN, STEVOR and Pfmc-2TM families, and the PHIST domain family which likely function within the erythrocyte cytoplasm. The human malaria parasite, P. vivax, and the rodent malaria parasites possess large families of proteins which are topologically similar to the 2TM proteins and also harbor Pexel/HT motifs, suggesting that the function of the 2TM proteins is widely conserved in Plasmodium. 
We have shown using primary and second generation clonal lines of the P. falciparum isolate, NF54 that expression of stevor and Pfmc-2TM families is clonally variant and undergoes switching. Moreover, the STEVOR and Pfmc-2TM families possess a loop between the 2TM domains that is hypervariable both between paralogs and across isolate boundaries, suggesting that it is exposed to host immune pressure at the erythrocyte surface. Thus host immune pressure has likely driven the amplification and antigenic diversification of the 2TM protein families, and a mechanism of gene expression switching insures that immune responses do not eliminate parasite infections. The topological and sequence similarity of the 2TM proteins to subunits of ion channels prompted us to consider that they might encode the new permeability pathways (NPPs) of infected erythrocytes. 
We propose here to test this hypothesis using genetically manipulated parasite lines that either dominantly express epitope-tagged versions of 2TM proteins or are globally knocked down in 2TM protein expression via conscription of specific transcription factors. These parasite lines will be used phenotypic assays, such as sorbitol lysis and whole-cell patch clamp. We also present evidence that the methodology of gene knockdown via transcription factor conscription can be used to address the function of other sub-telomeric gene families in P. falciparum, and thereby are likely to contribute to our understanding of parasite-encoded modifications of the infected erythrocyte. 
We present preliminary studies on the gene expression and cellular localization of select PHIST domain proteins and propose to pursue their function via targeted gene disruption as well as determination of predicted protein-protein interactions within the erythrocyte cytoplasm. In this manner we hope to generate hypotheses on the identity of the functional pressures which have driven the amplification of the PHIST domain family to over 6 members in P. falciparum. 
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Malaria remains a public health concern to approximately 40% of the world's population, particularly in the face of increasing drug resistance and the continued absence of an effective vaccine. This proposal focuses on two amplified sub-telomeric gene families, the first encoding the 2TM proteins which uniformly possess signal peptides, Pexel/HT erythrocyte trafficking motifs, and 2 transmembrane (2TM) regions that indicate an integral membrane topology. The second gene family encodes the PHIST domain proteins which include over 60 members and are predicted to function with the erythrocyte cytoplasm. The 2TM proteins are conserved in all species of Plasmodium, not as orthologous families but rather as topologically conserved integral membrane proteins. Thus their function, likely at the erythrocyte surface, is predicted to all be conserved across the Plasmodium clade. In this proposal we argue that the profound amplification of the 2TM gene families, their diversity between paralogs and across isolate boundaries, localization to the erythrocyte membrane, and topological similarity to sub-units of ion channels, combine to make them premier candidates for comprising the new permeability pathways in infected erythrocytes. We describe a spectrum of studies in which to test this hypothesis, including new methods to knockdown expression of gene families. The expression, cellular localization, and phenotype following targeted gene disruption will be studied for select PHIST domain proteins toward an understanding of their function within the erythrocyte cytoplasm.

Chan School of Public Health,Manoj T. Duraisingh,,"Malaria continues to be a major global health burden, with the emergence and spread of antimalarial resistance a significant threat to control efforts. The genetic basis of drug- resistance is not completely understood. We need new approaches to identify both drug- resistance determinants and genetic validation for small molecule inhibitors in development. Genome sequences are now available and forward genetics approaches to identify the molecules underlying drug-resistance are urgently needed. 
We hypothesize that functional complementation using the primate malaria parasite Plasmodium knowlesi will be able to identify determinants underlying drug-resistance. P. knowlesi parasite lines will be selected for resistance to small molecule inhibitors of interest. Cosmid libraries will be constructed from P. knowlesi parasites resistant to specific drugs of interest, which is feasible due to its GC-rich base composition. These cosmid libraries will be transfected into drug-susceptible P. knowlesi and P. falciparum parasites, and screened for genes that confer resistance to specific antimalarials. Our system is a novel approach in malaria biology that will have broad application, simultaneously identifying new drug resistance determinants and providing genetic validation. 
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drug-resistance in malaria is undermining control measures. We will establish a novel genetic system in the malaria parasite for the identification of genes that are involved in drug-resistance. This will provide us with tools to monitor drug- resistance in the public, as well as identify targets that will aid in the development of new drugs.

Dual Function Acridones as A New Antimalarial Chemotype,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=7936215,Project,Sep-09,Aug-12,,$934 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,Portland State University,Jane X. Kelly,,"Malaria remains one of the world's deadliest diseases, destroying lives by the millions and staggering families, communities and even nations with a burden that crushes hope. The demoralizing impact of the disease extends beyond the annual body count to effects on family and social structure, on sustained poverty in endemic areas, and in creating untold suffering for 40% of the world's population. The devastating situation is largely attributed to and aggravated by the emergence and spread of multi-drug resistant Plasmodium falciparum, the cause of the most deadly form of malaria. 
Monotherapy and highly mutable drug targets have each facilitated resistance, and both are undesirable in effective long-term strategies against MDR malaria. With no available vaccine currently or in the near future, there is a dire need for novel, low cost, effective, safe, and sustainable malaria treatment. If a global effort to eradicate malaria is to be successful, both chemotherapeutic and chemoprophylactic components of that effort must address the gaps and weaknesses in the armamentarium of currently available therapies. Affordability, safety in the most vulnerable, and low susceptibility to drug resistance adaptations each represent unmet needs. In contrast to other drug classes (e.g., respiratory inhibitors and anti-folates), development of drug resistance to quinoline antimalarials has been slow (e.g., chloroquine) or of low order (e.g.,quinine). For older drugs in this class, cost is very low, there is extensive experience with their use in children and during pregnancy, and short-course therapy is facilitated by very long drug elimination times. Paradoxically then, although the failure of chloroquine is at the core of the global drug-resistance crisis, these drugs actually characterize the ideals now sought in new antimalarial drugs for both treatment and intermittent prophylaxis. 
The novel chemotype described in this proposal and in our recent publication featured in Nature represents a revolutionary approach. It specifically aims to exploit the strengths of other compounds with ideal traits by making possible a new combination therapy strategy. Our innovative acridone design addresses an immutable parasite target and merges intrinsic potency with resistance-counteracting functions in a single molecule, and is the first and only chemotype reported to do so. It represents a novel strategy to expand, enhance, and sustain effective antimalarial drug combinations. The ability to enhance the efficacy of newer drugs (e.g., piperaquine) and to restore the efficacy of older drugs (e.g., chloroquine) represents a uniquely powerful tool, and one ideally suited to achieve the broadest possible benefit as a renewed malaria eradication effort proceeds. Given the scope of the global impact of malaria, the significance of success in these efforts would be nothing less than improving the lives of millions of individuals and the chance to change the face of entire nations. 
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This application entitled ""Dual Function Acridones As A New Antimalarial Chemotype"" addresses broad Challenge Area (15) Translational Science and specific Challenge Topic 15-AI-103: Develop drugs for neglected tropical diseases, with a special emphasis on malaria. We have discovered and seek to improve dual function antimalarial acridones for treatment of malaria. Millions die each year from malaria, and there is a great need for new antimalarial drugs that are effective against multi-drug resistant infection, safe in children and during pregnancy. If these drugs prove to be safe and effective enough to go into actual use, the potential benefit is nothing less than saving millions of lives.

Dried blood spots will be obtained a large cross-sectional study, the 2014 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), and from a new prospective study of 1000 individuals in 4 sites with varying levels of endemicity. Gametocytemia will be measured by reverse transcriptase PCR. 
Our first aim is to map the gametocyte reservoir and determine how individual, community-level, and ecological factors determine an individual's risk for gametocyte carriage. 
Our second aim is to identify barriers and corridors of gene flow. The structure of the P. falciparum at each cluster in the DHS will be assessed using neutral microsatellites. The genetic distances between parasite subpopulations will be calculated using population genetic metrics (Rst, Gst, Nm) and used to infer corridors of, and barriers to, gene flow.

This latter model will be developed into a user-friendly freely available PC-based tool to allow the impact of targeted control to be explored in DRC and the surrounding region.
 This project represents a unique multidisciplinary collaboration between molecular epidemiologists, medical geographers and mathematical modelers. By incorporating results from molecular and spatial epidemiological studies into mathematical models, we hope to develop a useful and practical tool for malaria control.

Humans can harbor malaria parasites at transmissible level while remaining asymptomatic (Githeko et al. 1992, Kimbi et al. 2005), such individuals are unlikely to seek chemotherapy, thus maintain malaria transmission to affect the malaria vulnerable group (Reuben 1993, Macauley 2005). 
Several studies have looked on the prevalence of parasitemic asymptomatic individuals in endemic and low transmission settings. Similar studies have not been conducted in well characterized urban settings of low transmission, with high levels of access to diagnosis and treatment in Africa and indeed very little is known about how the prevalence and absolute number of cases of asymptomatic human infections with P.falciparum distributed among different age groups in urban Dar es Salaam, an area where parasites transmission has been reduced to very low levels in Tanzania. This study will address these knowledge gaps.

Plasmodium Falciparum Infection and Interference with Effective B Cell Memory,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8701920,Project,Jun-14,May-16,,$237 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,"University of California, San Francisco (UCSF)",Bryan Greenhouse,,"Naturally acquired immunity is critical in modulating morbidity and mortality from falciparum malaria in endemic areas, where some individuals are infected hundreds of times per year. Humoral responses to Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) are a critical component of this immunity, and Pf-specific memory B cells (MBCs) are likely important in the development and maintenance of an effective response. Unfortunately, protection from clinical disease takes many years to develop, during which time children living in endemic areas experience multiple episodes of symptomatic malaria, resulting in over 1 million deaths annually.
Why does antimalarial immunity develop so slowly? One potential explanation is that Pf infection interferes with the development of effective B cell memory. An atypical phenotype of MBC, exhibiting evidence for lower affinity maturation and less capacity for differentiation into antibody secreting cells, has recently been described in the blood of HIV infected subjects.
Recent studies have demonstrated that people living in malaria endemic areas have elevated frequencies of similar atypical MBCs, but the relationship between Pf exposure and frequencies of atypical MBCs has not been investigated in detail. Moreover, it is unclear what the consequences of these cells are in malaria infected individuals.
We hypothesize that frequent exposure to Pf results in the selective diversion of Pf-specific B cells into an atypical MBC phenotype, delaying the acquisition of protective immunity to Pf. We are in a unique position to test this hypothesis, with access to a well characterized cohort of subjects living in an area of high but heterogeneous malaria transmission intensity and established laboratory infrastructure. Pf transmission intensity at our site in Tororo, Uganda ranks among the highest in the world, and preliminary data from this site suggest that affinity of Pf-specific antibody responses may be compromised in this setting.
We will test our hypothesis with the following Specific Aims: 1) To measure the association between Pf exposure and enrichment of atypical memory B cells in children living in a high transmission region of Uganda.;and 2) To measure the association between enrichment of atypical memory B cells and serological and parasitological evidence of protective humoral immunity to malaria.
We anticipate this study will show that increased exposure to Pf is associated with increased defects in B cell memory, characterized by higher proportions of Pf-specific MBCs showing an atypical phenotype and evidence of reduced Pf-specific antibody affinity and ability to control blood stage parasites. If so, counter to prevailig notions that malaria control efforts will delay the acquisition of immunity, strategies designed to reduce exposure may have a positive impact on immunity. In addition, methods to characterize Pf-specific B cells developed in this study will have broad application for investigating humoral immunity to Pf.

Variant surface antigens and immunity to malaria,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8118080,Project,Jul-07,Jun-13,,$2 200 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,Drexel University,James Matthew Burns,,"Much attention is focused on the development and testing of blood-stage malaria vaccines that target antigens expressed on the surface of merozoites (MSPs) given their functional importance in the invasion of erythrocytes and accessibility to serum antibodies. These efforts have been guided by in vitro studies of Plasmodium falciparum and in vivo studies of rodent malarial parasites that demonstrated the antibody- mediated inhibition of merozoite invasion of mature erythrocytes. However, data from studies of Plasmodium yoelii suggest that in vivo, these same antibodies are insufficient to prevent merozoites from invading reticulocytes. This does not appear to be due solely to differences in the receptors on host erythrocytes engaged by distinct merozoite proteins. This issue must be addressed if MSP-based vaccines are to be effective against Plasmodium vivax, a reticulocyte-restricted malaria parasite. 
Our hypothesis is that RBCs infected with reticulocyte-restricted malaria parasites localize to sites of erythropoiesis in vivo, mature and release merozoites into an environment that favors interaction with newly formed reticulocytes and reduces exposure to merozoite neutralizing antibodies. To test this hypothesis, we will conduct in vitro and vivo studies with P. yoelii blood-stage parasites that mimic the restricted or non-restricted host cell preferences of the human malarial parasites. We will focus on plasmodial proteins and variant surface antigens expressed on the reticulocyte surface, on their role in mediating adherence of pRBCs to vascular endothelium and on their role in immune evasion. Specifically, we will define the subset of plasmodial erythrocyte membrane protein genes expressed in P. yoelii infected reticulocytes which adhere to vascular endothelial cells and monitor changes in their expression in parasites under immune pressure. We will identify surface-exposed, P. yoelii reticulocyte membrane proteins that bind to receptors expressed on vascular endothelial cells. We will determine if antibodies that block adherence of P. yoelii infected reticulocytes to vascular endothelium in vitro also block localization of parasites to erythropoietic tissues in vivo and enhance the efficacy of MSP-based vaccines. These studies are built on the success of the malaria genome sequencing efforts, the ability to monitor the concurrent expression of large multigene families by microarray analysis, and the utilization of well-defined rodent models to conduct in vivo studies. 
Relevance: P. vivax causes 70-80 million cases of malaria each year. Efforts to develop vaccines to reduce P. vivax malaria are critical but must consider the unique aspects of the growth of this parasite in vivo. The proposed studies will increase our understanding of the factors that favor parasite invasion of subpopulations of erythrocytes in vivo to improve the design of vaccines that effectively inhibit the process.

Kim Lee Sim,,"Plasmodium vivax (Pv) is responsible for hundreds of millions of malaria cases annually, as many cases of malaria in travelers as P. falciparum (Pf), and a substantial economic burden. Severe malaria with mortality due to Pv has recently been reported from Oceania, south Asia, and South America. During the last decade, drug resistant Pv has emerged. There is a huge potential market for a Pv vaccine in travelers and military from the developed world, and among populations in countries with endemic Pv.Pv vaccine research has been neglected. 
The fact that Pf and Pv co-exist in most malaria endemic areas worldwide presents technical and ethical constraints for deployment of a vaccine effective only against Pf. Malaria cannot be eradicated without eliminating Pv. The only subunit malaria vaccines that have been reproducibly shown to prevent Pf malaria in humans are based on the Pf circumsporozoite protein (PfCSP). These protective vaccines elicit antibodies against the central repeat region of the molecule, which is conserved in all isolates of Pf, and against T cell epitopes in the C-terminal flanking region. It has not been possible to produce successfully a PfCSP recombinant (rec) protein vaccine that includes the N-terminal flanking region. Development of a PvCSP rec protein vaccine has been complicated by the fact that there are 2 major alleles of the PvCSP (210 and 247) based on variation in sequence of the central repeats.
 In Phase I we constructed PvCSP rec proteins that combined 3 copies of PvCSP 210 repeats and 3 copies of PvCSP 247 repeats with N-terminus (Protein 1), C- terminus (Protein 2) or N- and C-termini (Protein 3) of the PvCSP. All were expressed at levels adequate for GMP production. Protein 2 aggregated making purification and characterization difficult. All induced in mice antibodies that recognized PvCSP and Pv sporozoites expressing PvCSP 210 or 247, and inhibited Pv sporozoite invasion and development in human hepatocytes. Protein 2 did not induce antibodies against the Pv247 repeats, and could not be evaluated in T cell studies. Protein 3 induced better immune responses than Protein 1, and since Protein 3 includes essentially the full-length protein with all B and T cell epitopes, we have selected Protein 3 for Phase II. 
In Phase II we will: 1) Optimize protein 3 expression and generate a master clone and master cell bank, 2) Define specifications for fermentation procedure at scale under cGMPs, 3) Formulate candidate protein with 4 different adjuvants, 4) Down select optimal protein/adjuvant/formulation by comparative immunogenicity in mice and monkeys, 5) Define specifications for process, generate technical transfer records and documentation for cGMP manufacture, 6) Manufacture vaccine, conduct release assays, release bulk drug substance and conduct stability studies.

Targeting the Mitochondrion of P. falciparum,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8681306,Project,Jul-12,Jun-16,,$1 300 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,"Broad Institute, US",Dyann Wirth,,"The mitochondrion of P. falciparum is stripped of many of the typical functions of mitochondria, yet retains pathways essential to the parasite survival. The remaining mitochondrial functions are proving to be an exceptionally productive set of targets for antimalarial drug discovery. 
One approach to overcoming drug resistance is to design new drugs such that the fitness cost of resistance restricts the ability of mutant parasites to survive combination therapy or to persist in the absence of selection. Through whole organism high-throughput screening we have discovered many new chemotypes that appear to act on mitochondrial targets. 
We propose to take a chemical biology approach to the mitochondrion and develop these into a suite of reagents useful in characterizing mitochondrial function by pinpointing mechanisms of action and resistance for a range of chemotypes that act against the mitochondrion. 
We will study the effects of the resistance mutations on the structure and function of the targets and the impact of those mutations and consequent biochemical changes on parasite growth and fitness in vitro. We will select resistance to a range of chemical inhibitors that appear to target the mitochondrial ETC, focusing on DHODH. Using an approach that has proven highly productive, we will characterize the resistant mutants to identify the target of the chemical inhibitor. 
We propose to conduct selections in sufficient depth and using a sufficiently diverse range of chemistry to sample the range of possible targets and mechanisms affecting the mitochondrial ETC, and to explore the range of resistance mutations to DHODH inhibitors intensively, focusing on the compound advancing to clinical testing. We will screen previously identified DHODH inhibitor screening hits for those active against the resistant parasites. We will map the resistance mutations of mutants newly isolated and assess the biological consequences by measuring the effects of the mutations on the enzyme, on mitochondrial function and on the growth of the organism.

Anchoring and uniting the An. funestus assembly for improved vector analysis,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8748370,Project,Jun-14,May-16,,$239 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,"University of Notre Dame, USA",Nora J. Besansky,,"Anopheles funestus is one of the three most important and widespread vectors of human malaria in tropical Africa, but unlike An. gambiae with which it broadly co-occurs, it is a relatively neglected species. It shares with An. gambiae not only a broad sub-Saharan distribution and major vector status, but also abundant chromosomal inversion polymorphism and apparently shallow population structure across much of Africa. 
However, there are behavioral and genetic heterogeneities relevant to malaria transmission that remain poorly understood. In the savannas of West Africa, where application of residual insecticides in the 1960's was not as successful against An. funestus as elsewhere in Africa, there is strong cytogenetic evidence for cryptic, temporally stable assortatively mating populations co-occurring in the same villages. In apparent analogy to the chromosomal forms of An. gambiae, the chromosomally recognized forms of An. funestus, named Kiribina and Folonzo cytotypes, seem to differ in larval ecology. Importantly, they also differ in adult behaviors affecting vectorial capacity, most notably indoor/outdoor resting behavior. 
At present, there exist no rapid molecular identification assays to facilitate more in-depth field studies of their behavior and genetics; the cytotypes can only be distinguished by laborious chromosomal karyotyping. 
Our long-term goal is to understand the underlying genomic determinants of epidemiologically important phenotypic and behavioral traits in An. funestus and its cytotypes. The newly sequenced An. funestus genome begins to make possible this goal, but its fragmented state, unanchored to chromosomes, poses a barrier that hinders the identification of causal loci affecting traits of interest. The central goal of this R21 is to upgrade the draft An. funestus reference to a chromosome-based assembly in which the unanchored scaffolds are united, ordered and oriented on chromosome arms, enabling a preliminary assessment of genomic divergence between the cytotypes. 
Toward this end, we propose three specific Aims: 1. Integrate the assembly with the cytogenetic map by physical mapping. 2. Unite, order and orient unanchored scaffolds using single molecule sequencing. 3. Assess divergence between An. funestus cytotypes by genome scans. The innovative strategy of integrating a powerful new sequencing technology with traditional physical mapping to chromosomes will transform the draft reference into a chromosome-based assembly, and provide the means to uncover in An. funestus and its cytotypes the genetic basis of traits that affect disease transmission.

Paratransgenesis for malaria using Asaia sp. Bacteria,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8767309,Project,Aug-14,Jul-17,,$396 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,Duquesne University ,David J. Lampe,,"Malaria is a disease caused by protozoan parasites that are transmitted to humans by mosquitoes in the genus Anopheles. There are nearly 500 million new cases of malaria every year, and from 1-2 million people die from the disease while others are severely debilitated. About half the human population is at risk of contracting malaria, and its range may spread as global warming accelerates. 
The broad, long term objectives of this proposal are to create new methods of combating malaria to complement the current methods of control, namely insecticides to kill mosquito vectors and drugs to kill parasites in infected people. This project seeks to develop the means to create strains of bacteria that can interfere with the ability of mosquitoes to transmit malaria thus reducing its overall health burden and aiding in the goal of eradicating this disease. 
The specific aims of this research project are as follows: Aim 1: Creation of strains of Asaia SF2.1 that secrete anti-Plasmodium effector proteins using native secretion signals. Asaia SF2.1 is intimately associated with Anopheles mosquitoes in the field, colonizing the midgut, salivary glands, and gonads of these insects. Thus it has optimal microbial ecology on which to build a paratransgenesis system against malaria. We will develop native secretion systems using genomic data and a genetic screen for the secretion of anti-malarial effector proteins from Asaia SF2.1 to ensure efficient secretion of these proteins in mosquito midguts. Aim 2: Isolation of strong conditional promoters from Asaia SF2.1. Antimalarial effector proteins must be expressed when the parasite is present in the mosquito midgut and in sufficient quantities to be effective. We will isolate strong conditional promoters from Asaia SF2.1 that are active when bacteria are present during a blood meal using a genetic screen, genomic homology searches, and RNAseq. Aim 3: Creation of genetically stable strains of transgenic Asaia SF2.1. 
For eventual field use, paratransgenic strains of bacteria must be genetically stable. They cannot be based on laboratory plasmids that are maintained with drug selection. We will develop methods to create strains that contain genes inserted in the chromosome or borne on plasmids that need no drug selection.

Extreme Resistance to Mitochondrial Inhibitors in Plasmodium falciparum,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8624359,Project,Aug-14,Jul-16,,$213 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,University of South Florida,Dennis E. Kyle,,"Malaria is a major health problem worldwide, with over 300 million people becoming infected and up to one million deaths annually. The emergence and spread of resistance to most anti-malarial drugs has made the effective treatment of malaria difficult and there is an urgent need for new anti-malarial drugs or drug combinations. 
Atovaquone is a safe, effective drug that is used in combination with proguanil for the treatment and prevention of malaria. Previous studies have shown that clinical resistance to atovaquone is conferred by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the mitochondrial encoded cytochrome b gene of P. falciparum. Although multiple non-synonymous SNPs can be selected under drug pressure in vitro, thus far clinical resistance is limited to amino acid substitutions at position 268 (e.g., Y268S). 
From phase II studies of atovaquone in Thailand, we have characterized multiple isolates of P. falciparum that were collected from patients that failed treatment with atovaquone alone (various dose regimens) or in combination with either proguanil or pyrimethamine. Interestingly, we observed a broad range of resistance to atovaquone, from 5 to >10,000 fold in these isolates. The low-grade resistant isolates possessed no cytochrome b mutations, whereas the moderate to extreme resistant isolates all had aa268 mutations. Given the broad range of resistance observed, more than just the Y268S mutation seemed likely to be the sole basis for resistance. 
By using a series of inhibitors we found extremely atovaquone resistant parasites that are highly resistant to all drugs tested that target the mitochondria. These include the normally potent 4(1H)-quinolones and pyridones, and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) inhibitors. 
The major goals of this project are to identify the molecular markers of resistance, that along with cytochrome b mutations convey an extreme resistance phenotype. We will clone P. falciparum from admission and recrudescence isolates from the atovaquone Phase 2 clinical studies to obtain reference clones with low, moderate, and extreme resistance to mitochondrial inhibitors. We will use next generation sequencing to identify novel SNPs or CNVs associated with resistance;this effort will be aided by comparing the resistant clones with P. falciparum clones from the same patient prior to treatment. In addition, we will test the hypothesis that extreme resistance was selected in vivo by simultaneous exposure to atovaquone and pyrimethamine. Finally we will assess the potential for transmission of resistance genotypes to mosquitos. 
The results of these studies will provide critical knowledge about the resistance risks and potential for spread of extreme resistance to mitochondrial inhibitors in the field.

Safety and efficacy of PfSPZ malaria vaccine in malaria-exposed adults,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8732334,Project,Jan-15,Dec-18,Burkina Faso,$661 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,University of Maryland,Chris Plowe ,,"A malaria vaccine that blocks infection by Plasmodium falciparum with high efficacy would also prevent malaria transmission, improving prospects for regional malaria elimination and eventual global eradication. Immunization of humans by exposure to mosquitoes carrying radiation-attenuated P. falciparum sporozoites protects >90% of volunteers against experimental P. falciparum challenge. 
Our collaborators at Sanaria Inc. have developed a manufacturing process for obtaining purified P. falciparum sporozoites for human administration by needle injection. This product, the ""PfSPZ Vaccine"", is produced in aseptically raised adult Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes fed on blood cultures containing aseptic P. falciparum gametocytes. After infected mosquitoes are irradiated to attenuate the sporozoites, these radiation-attenuated sporozoites are isolated, purified, and the final product is cryopreserved. 
A recent study found that five intravenous (IV) doses of the PfSPZ Vaccine had 100% protective efficacy in the highest dose group. Obstacles that must be overcome to establish the utility of this vaccine include assessment of its safety and efficacy against genetically diverse natural parasites in malaria-endemic populations, and diminishing the number of doses required to achieve high protection. 
We aim to advance the clinical development of this vaccine in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation Phase 1 clinical trial in Balonghin, Burkina Faso, where malaria is endemic. To evaluate the importance of total sporozoite dose and number and timing of doses to immunogenicity and efficacy in a population with pre-existing antimalarial immunity, we will use twice the total cumulative dose that provided 100% efficacy in the NIH study to compare the same dosing schedule used in that study against three doses spaced either 8 or 12 weeks apart. Ninety healthy adults will be enrolled into three cohorts of 30, and randomized in a 2:1 ratio within each cohort to receive escalating doses of PfSPZ or placebo. Safety and tolerability, humoral and cell-mediated immunity, and exploratory measures of overall and strain-specific efficacy will be evaluated. 
This will be the first clinical trial to establish safety and tolerability of this promising malaria candidate vaccine in malaria-experienced individuals living in a malaria-endemic area, and the first evaluation of the efficacy of PfSPZ Vaccine against diverse P. falciparum strains that occur in nature. If successful, this trial will advance the clinical development of a vaccine intended to eliminate malaria from geographically defined areas through mass immunization and to prevent malaria in non-immune visitors to malarious areas, such as tourists and business, aid, diplomatic and military personnel. 
The exploration of immunological and parasite genomic endpoints will advance our understanding of vaccine-induced protective immunity to malaria and help to determine whether and how a multi-strain sporozoite vaccine should be developed to provide broad protection against genetically diverse malaria parasites.

If new classes of compounds are not discovered and approved, many of today's malaria treatments will become ineffective due to the emergence of resistance to current drugs. 
The focus of this effort will be to discover a drug candidate from a molecular class of compounds that does not show resistance to known anti-malarials. This compound class, referred to as pyrimidinylguanidines, was tested in four human clinical trials in the mid-1940s resulting in the relief of malaria symptoms with no evidence of any serious side effects. No drug was ever launched from this class since they did not display superiority to the emerging and existing therapies at the time. Thus, a more potent compound in the same class has a good chance of being safe, not showing resistance to current drugs, and being effective, at doses typical for preventing and treating malaria. 
The project will target improving the activity of this class of compounds that has been shown to be safe in human clinical trials, but has not been used extensively in people. In light of emerging resistance to many antimalarial drugs currently, it is prudent to fully investigate the therapeutic potential of this class of compounds.

We hope to find better drugs by better understanding the life-cycle of the parasite that causes it. We will focus on the weakest link of the parasite's life-cycle in humans, its infection of the liver. We will use chemical approaches to identify parasite proteins that are required for liver infection and new ways of developing drugs to block liver infection. Specifically, we will initiate studies designed to identify the target of a molecule that blocks liver infection by the parasite, in the petri dish and in mice. By identifying the target of the molecule, we can design more powerful drugs that are safe and effective for use in humans.

In fact, more person-days were lost among U.S. military personnel due to malaria than to bullets during every military campaign fought in malaria-endemic regions during the 20th century. Malaria also is a major threat to non-military travelers, who face this infection as likely the single greatest health risk associated with travel. Increasing drug and insecticide resistance highlight the importance of developing an effective malaria vaccine. Vaccine efforts to control Plasmodium causing malaria have only been partly successful with 50.4% protection by the RTS,S/AS01E vaccine targeting the circumsporozoite protein (CSP). A major shortcoming of this vaccine approach is a failure to induce high frequencies of cytotoxic T cells that can eliminate malaria at the liver stage of infection. 
We have previously shown that cell-based vaccines secreting heat shock protein gp96 are safe for use in humans and represent the most efficient vaccine approach studied to date for stimulating cytotoxic T cells. In the proposed studies, we will adapt this vaccine approach to stimulate cytotoxic T cells against malaria antigens and investigate the optimal vaccination route to target these T cells to the liver. 
To accomplish these studies, we will collaborate with experts in the malaria vaccine field, Capt. Thomas L. Richie, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Navy's malaria research program at the Naval Medical Research Center and coordinator of the U.S. Military Malaria Vaccine Program. Capt. Richie has extensive research experience in human and non-human primate malaria prophylaxis studies, most recently in testing efficacy of adenovirus 5 (Ad5)-vectored Plasmodium falciparum malaria vaccines. Due to this experience, the appropriate personnel, equipment, facilities, and protocols to conduct immunogenicity studies of gp96-Ig-based malaria vaccines are already in place. 
The project will be organized such that the expertise of Dr. Podack in generating new cell-based gp96-Ig vaccines is utilized during the first two aims of the grant to generate a candidate malaria vaccine and determine its immunogenicity in mouse models. In aim 3, the vaccines generated by Dr. Podack will be transferred to Capt. Richie for coordination of the non-human primate immunogenicity studies. This collaboration strategy optimizes the individual expertise of both PIs on the grant. Importantly, the NHP immunogenicity studies will be conducted at the facilities and using protocols previously used for testing of recent clinical candidates for malaria prophylaxis. 
By conducting head-to-head studies to another promising malaria vaccine, these studies will help to set clinical priorities based on the most effective pre-clinical data in animal models.

Complement and Antibody-Mediated Enhancement of Erythrocyte Invasion by Plasmodium Falciparum,http://www.malariaeradication.org/mesa-track/complement-and-antibody-mediated-enhancement-erythrocyte-invasion-plasmodium-falciparum,Project,Aug-14,Jul-16,,$188 000,"Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs (CDMRP), USA",,,Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center,Jose A. Stoute,,"Malaria is a blood parasite transmitted by mosquitoes. It is responsible for close to one million deaths per year. Plasmodium falciparum is the deadliest of all the malaria species that infect humans. As part of its life cycle, the parasite invades and destroys red blood cells. Development of a vaccine against P. falciparum has been an elusive goal. One problem with experimental vaccines that are designed with the goal of preventing red blood cell invasion is that while they reduce the growth of the parasite in the test tube, they do not prevent infections when tested in humans. 
We hypothesize that the explanation for this discrepancy is that some antibodies can actually enhance the ability of the parasite by activating part of the innate immune response known as complement. We know that P. falciparum is able to interact with a complement receptor on the red blood cell surface known as complement receptor 1 (CR1). Activation of the complement cascade likely allows complement proteins to bind to the parasite and this in turn allows it to bind to CR1 facilitating red blood cell invasion. However, the parasite also produces a protein of its own called PfRh4 that is able to interact with CR1. 
In this proposal, we will carry out preliminary experiments to determine the merit of our hypothesis. We will do this by achieving the following objectives: (1) Test whether anti-malaria antibodies can enhance red cell invasion in the presence of complement. (2) Test the effect of CR1 blockade on the ability of the parasite to enter red blood cells in the absence or presence of complement. (3) Produce a parasite line that lacks PfRh4. (4) Test in a mouse model whether antibodies against malaria can enhance RBC invasion. 
Our studies will have important repercussions for the way scientists have gone about testing and developing malaria vaccines that block red blood cell invasion. If we are correct, malaria vaccines will have to be tested to account for the effect of complement. In addition, it is possible that antibodies that do not activate complement may be more effective than those that do activate complement. Therefore, future malaria vaccines may need to be designed to bias the immune response towards the induction of antibodies that do not activate complement.

Since February 2009 she has been conducting entomological studies at the Papua New Guinea Institute of Medical Research (PNGIMR). She has demonstrated strengths as a vector biologist in the field and laboratory and successfully leads a research team of Papua New Guinean scientists, technicians and students. In order to meet her long-term career objectives as an independent investigator researching malaria transmission dynamics, she requires mentorship in the areas of malaria epidemiology and disease transmission. Further training in statistics, study design and research ethics will allow her to develop skills necessary to conduct competitive and comprehensive research. Drs.

Dr. Zimmerman's lab has worked closely with Dr. Mueller's lab over the last ten years to strengthen the molecular epidemiology program at PNGIMR and to establish training curricula for Fogarty International Center sponsored programs. Dr. Reimer's background in mosquito biology and the proposed mentorship in malaria epidemiology and transmission will make it possible for her to complete novel research in transmission dynamics. 
The Anopheles punctulatus complex includes 12 species of mosquitoes, encompassing many of the major malaria vectors in Papua New Guinea. Many of the species within this complex are isomorphic, and it is only recently that molecular techniques have been developed to aid in identification. In addition, four human malaria species are endemic in Papua New Guinea, and are transmitted year round. This matrix of vector and parasite species produces a variable transmission landscape, which is effected by vector and parasite species distributions, vector ecology, and vector-parasite interactions. 
Previous studies have identified key behavioral characteristics of many vector species, including biting times, biting rates, and host indices. On-going studies are gathering similar information for vector species correctly identified using molecular techniques. However, information regarding the inherent physiological ability of these vectors to maintain and transmit Plasmodium is scarce. It is necessary to take vector competence into account in order to effectively control malaria in such a complicated vector-parasite environment. 
The primary aim of this study is to determine the malaria transmission potential of four common species of Anopheles in Papua New Guinea. Colony mosquitoes will be experimentally infected by feeding them with a sample of blood containing a known number of either Plasmodium falciparum or P. vivax gametocytes. The infection within the mosquito will be monitored by recording both oocyst densities in the midgut as well as sporozoite densities in the salivary glands. In addition, since mixed Plasmodium infections are common in human and mosquito populations, the secondary aim of this study is to determine the ability of An. punctulatus to maintain a mixed infection of P. falciparum and P. vivax. Colony mosquitoes will be fed a sample of blood with a mixed infection and parasite development will be monitored. In addition, the effect of an initial P. falciparum infection on subsequent P. vivax development will be measured, and vice versa.

Using a bioinformatics approach, we will create, score, and select in silico-generated recombinants of natural antigen variants designed to express mosaics that maximize the inclusion of common potential in one structure and minimize the inclusion of rare epitopes. Antigenic properties of the recombinant antigens are validated by indirect ELISA using panels of well-characterized sera from apparently healthy individuals and clinical Pf and Pv malaria patients. The utility of the recombinant antibodies are evaluated in a dipstick test using a range of clinical urine samples from Pf/Pv endemic regions. 
Our overall objective is to develop a simple one-step urine-based dipstick test for the simultaneous but specific diagnosis of clinical Pf and/or Pv malaria. The broader impact/commercial potential of this project relates to the development of a broad-based one step urine test for home-based or point-of-care diagnosis of clinical Pf and/or Pv malaria in persons with fever. The test will potentially provide a reliable tool to differentiate between symptomatic and asymptomatic disease, and provide better treatment options to those in need. It will potentially offer wider acceptability of clinical malaria diagnosis in endemic regions, especially in remote settings and in places where mixed infections frequently occur by obviating the occupational hazards involved with phlebotomy, thus helping to reduce the unnecessary use of antimalarial drugs. 
Overall, it has the potential to markedly impact the way over 95% of all clinical malaria is diagnosed and treated in endemic regions, and drive the current global effort towards home-based or point-of-care testing for malaria mandated by the World Health Organization prior to treatment in all cases of fever. Since it is based on the same platform as current RDTs, this test can be easily integrated into current healthcare structures to provide significant benefits to public health in most endemic countries.

Out of the 4 species that cause malaria in humans Plasmodium vivax is the most prevalent species outside tropical Africa. Although rarely fatal, P.vivax causes debilitating disease that severely affects the quality of life and economic productivity of the victims. P.vivax genome sequence based on the the SAL-1 strain of P.vivax is almost complete and is available to the public (http:www.tigr.org/tdb/e2k1/pva1/). However, it does not provide any information on the genetic diversity or polymorphism of this parasite. Genetic variation is central to the pathogenesis of an organism and has significantly impeded progress towards the development of an effective malaria vaccine. Thus assessment of genetic diversity among parasite populations as proposed in this study has significant relevance for better understanding of its biology, for the development of strategies of disease control and to make valid estimations with regard to its origin.  Malaria is one of the most important public health problems in many parts of world due to the high morbidity and mortality it causes, especially in young children. Better understanding of the genetic structure and its changes in the causative parasite, the objective of this proposed study, would enable the development of effective control strategies to combat this devastating disease that mostly affect the poor communities in the developing world.
","This study proposes an in depth analysis, including identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), in a 300 kb segment within the P.vivax genome by PCR-based sequencing of this region in 4 P.vivax strains with different geographical origins.

This would enable the understanding of natural variation, population structure, genetic diversity and polymorphism, including the range of allele frequency spectrum and the patterns of linkage disequilibrium in recently archived field parasite isolates representing the global malaria endemic zones, which in turn would enable better understanding of the biology, population genetics and evolutionary history of this neglected parasite species.",Basic science,"P. vivax, Parasite genetic diversity"
Immune Response to P. vivax in Duffy (-) Humans,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8105881,Project,Aug-10,Jul-12,Colombia,$2 400 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,Seattle Biomedical Research Institute,Ruobing Wang,,"At least 20% of the 300-500 million annual cases of malaria are caused by infection with Plasmodium vivax. Although P. vivax malaria is rarely lethal, it causes a great deal of human suffering and inhibits economic development in many malaria-endemic countries. P. vivax is relatively little studied compared to the most lethal human malaria parasite P. falciparum, primarily because it cannot be cultured in vitro. Consequently, far less progress has been achieved in P. vivax vaccine development compared to P. falciparum. 
Invasion of P. vivax merozoites into reticulocytes is dependent upon the expression of the Duffy antigen/receptor for chemokines (DARC) on the reticulocyte surface. Individuals lacking DARC [F(y-)J are completely resistant to infection by P. vivax blood stages, but should be susceptible to liver stage infections initiated by the invasion of sporozoites. Furthermore, liver stage parasites should develop normally in Fy(-) individuals, but the merozoites released from the liver would not be expected to initiate blood stage infections. Consequently, Fy(-) individuals residing in P. vivax endemic areas who are exposed to infected mosquitoes should exhibit immune responses primarily to liver stage antigens, whereas Fy(+) individuals should respond to both liver and blood stage antigens, with a predominant response directed to the blood stage antigens. 
It should be possible to use lymphocytes from Fy(-) individuals in novel assays proposed here to identify pre-erythrocytic stage P. vivax antigens that are targets of cellular immune responses. Lymphocytes and sera will be collected from Fy(+) and Fy(-) individuals living in P. vivax endemic areas in Columbia. 
Novel ELISPOT assays and IF As will be used to characterize the immune responses to 100 novel proteins identified from the P. vivax genome sequence. Immunogenicity studies will be conducted in mice to confirm that the antigenic proteins identified through the in vitro screening process in human immune cells are immunogenic in vivo, and to generate the antisera for subcellular localization to confirm the stage specificity of the novel antigens.

Human Reservoirs of Plasmodium vivax Transmission in the Peruvian Amazon,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=7894763,Project,Jul-06,Jun-12,Peru,$3 400 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,"University of California, San Diego (UCSD)",Joseph M. Vinetz,,"Plasmodium vivax malaria, a leading health problem throughout the Amazon basin on Latin America, is endemic in the Peruvian Amazon. 
The long-term goal of this project is to determine specific epidemiological characteristics of P. vivax transmission and human reservoirs of maintaining P. vivax transmission in the Peruvian Amazon region towards the rational deployment of a transmission-blocking vaccine. 
This project will test the hypothesis that reproduction of exogenous P. vivax into local populations is responsible for continuing transmission in rural villages surrounding Iquitos, Peru, the capital of the Peruvian Amazon. Alternative hypotheses are 1) that relapsing P. vivax malaria is the source for maintaining local transmission;or 2) there is simply continuous transmission of already locally established genotypes within local populations. 
Specific aim 1 is to determine circulating Plasmodium vivax genotypes at the individual village level through prospective, population-based surveillance of people with P. vivax parasitemia. Changes or stability of P. vivax genotypes will be assessed over space and time using recently validated genetic markers. Specific aim 2 is to determine transmission dynamics of P. vivax using geographic spatio- temporal analysis of circulating genotypes using spatial statistical modeling and cluster analysis. These analyses will distinguish whether circulating P. vivax genotypes are already established in villages (either continuously circulating or resulting from relapsing P. vivax from hypnozoites) or are newly introduced by infected inhabitants returning from travel away from the village. Specific aim 3 is to determine whether transmission-blocking immunity develops in the Peruvian Amazon population to potentially modify P. vivax transmission dynamics. Membrane feeding studies will be performed using local Anopheles darlingi mosquitoes and local P. vivax patients as sources of parasites, and by experimental infections of Anopheles mosquitoes from splenectomized non-human primates infected experimentally with P. vivax. In vitro assays (ELISA, IFA) will be used to determine the validity of the in vivo mosquito infection assay. 
These data will provide the basis for planning transmission-blocking interventions and elimination of human reservoirs of P. vivax, and provide a rational basis for determining strategies to implement and deploy new transmission- blocking vaccines as one approach towards the future elimination of P. vivax malaria from the Amazon basin.

Newton001 Sero-surveillance to estimate the burden of Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum infection in Latin America,http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/project/949602CB-802F-4975-A261-EB1804CE8BDD,Project,Jan-15,Dec-15,,$78 000,"Medical Research Council (MRC), UK",,,London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM),"Chris Drakeley, Kevin Tetteh",,"Malaria elimination requires that activities focus on reducing parasite carriage within communities in addition to treating those sick with the disease. However, as malaria transmission levels decrease, it becomes harder to identify individuals who might be carrying parasites using conventional methods (microscopy, rapid diagnostic tests), as many of these infections will be of low density and asymptomatic. Therefore, there is a need for innovative and affordable approaches to identify likely parasite carriers and the areas where they reside.
One approach is serological surveillance. A malaria infection will leave an antibody 'footprint' in the serum of the human host that will last longer than the infection itself. Detection of these antibodies is an additional sensitive and specific approach to measure a population's level of exposure to infection. Using antibodies in this way has recently been revitalised by researchers at LSHTM as a method to estimate malaria burden with considerable accuracy.
Antibody measures have been shown to correlate with other conventional estimates of malaria burden (entomological, parasitological and clinical). It has also been shown that by evaluating the antibody responses and age of individuals it is possible to recreate the history of exposure to malaria. This facet allows a retrospective examination of the effect of malaria control interventions in a given locality. This work has primarily been conducted in African settings where Plasmodium falciparum is predominant, however a more recent analysis of samples from Para state, Brazil showed the approach was applicable in this setting. Therefore, the aim of this project is to extend this work by assembling the current evidence on sero-epidemiology and antibody dynamics in Latin America and extending this with novel antibody targets and analytical approaches.
The expected results of this project are to promote better understanding of the current landscape of sero-surveillance evidence in Latin America and to identify research needs to be addressed in future studies. These studies will be formulated to further strengthen collaboration between participating institutions in developing reliable sero-surveillance methods to estimate species-specific malaria burden in the region, target control methods and ultimately contribute to malaria elimination in the region. This proposal specifically addresses the need for rapid and reliable tools and strategies to measure malaria burden and we believe it will provide considerable information to guide policy makers in Latin America.
The project comprises four main parts:
1. Systematic review of seroepidemiology studies of malaria in Latin America. Data will be extracted on antigenic targets, serological measurements, malaria transmission intensity, demographic and geographical characteristics and study design. Meta-analysis will evaluate the correlation between serological measurements obtained with malaria transmission data from each location. A preliminary map of malaria sero-surveillance will be generated using geostatistical tools. Further evaluation will be made on studies which could provide data on differing serological patterns between new Pv infection and relapse episodes.
2. Repository of sero-survey samples from Brazil. A library of samples will be collated in Brazil and used to identify a broader range of antibody markers for future study.
3. Evaluation of antigenic targets. We will identify and evaluate antigenic sources previously described for assays in the review and reproduce these and newer candidate antigens using SLIC. Newer antigenic candidates will be identified in existing databases, including next generation sequence data. Purified antigens will be analysed by SDS PAGE and Western blot, using Pv positive control sera, to determine protein integrity and screen for immunoreactivity. Promising candidates will be further assayed primarily by ELISA, later with Luminex, against endemic sera identified above and archived in London.
4. Capacity & partnership strengthening. An initial meeting in Manaus will harmonize study design and methods. A second meeting will be held in November to: present and discuss results of the systematic review and sample repository; identify knowledge gaps in sero-surveillance in Latin America and plan future studies; and exchange knowledge and technology between research groups. Exchange of postdoctoral and PhD students from both countries will enable technology transfer on measurement and analysis of malaria sero-surveillance studies.

Landscape Molecular Epidemiology for Malaria Elimination,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8869080,Project,Aug-14,Jul-15,,$276 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,Arizona State University,Ananias Alberto Escalante,,"This investigation seeks to define a temporal and spatial pathway for reorienting malaria control into elimination by developing a landscape molecular epidemiology (LME) framework. Understanding the spatial aspects of malaria transmission is important because this information can be used to improve the efficiency of resource allocation and to identify areas at higher risk of reintroduction once elimination has been achieved locally. A priority in control programs is the identification of areas that sustain malaria transmission (hotspots) through the migration of infected individuals to other sites. This is particularly critical in countries with low transmission seeking to move from control to elimination. 
However, identifying malaria hotspots in such settings is often challenging both because of the increased prominence of stochastic effects in the disease dynamics and because of idiosyncratic features of the relatively small numbers of individuals that participate i transmission. This situation is made worse by the limited information on Plasmodium vivax, the most prevalent parasite outside Africa. Furthermore, whereas genetic information can be used to infer parasite dispersal between populations, the fact that malaria is endemic makes it difficul to interpret this data since the population structure of the parasite is influenced by short-term and long-term processes. 
To solve this problem, our LME approach will use a combination of epidemiological, genetic and environmental data to ascertain how malaria incidence is affected by the present-day connectivity of parasite populations. By developing a suite of epidemiological models that incorporate genetic information and by using landscape genetic methodologies, the proposed LME will be able to characterize the genetic structure of parasite populations on multiple spatial and temporal scales. 
This project will build on extensive preliminary studies in Colombia as part of a Malaria Research Center, CLAIM, currently supported by NIAID. It has three specific aims. First, we will characterize the influence of landscape features on the spatial and temporal structure of P. falciparum (Pf) and P. vivax (Pv) populations. Second, we will develop spatially-explicit individual-based models (IBMs) of Pf and Pv dynamics that relate malaria risk to spatial connectivity of parasite populations inferred from molecular data. Third, we will utilize our models to define a spatially-explicit pathway for malaria elimination in Colombia. 
This study will lead to several innovations. First, whereas methods integrating epidemiology and population genetics have been applied to many viruses and bacteria, malaria has lagged behind in these developments. Second, we will use remote sensing and multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to quantify malaria risk across the landscape as a function of factors such as precipitation and land cover, and we will validate and refine these predictions using the results of our genetic analyses. Third, the information gathered in the present study will have implications for other areas of Asia and South America where P. vivax is prevalent. 
To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the few studies that can compare the two major malaria parasites within a common setting.

RBL Binding Domain Malaria Candidate Vaccines,https://goo.gl/JmralW,Project,Mar-11,Feb-15,,$484 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,Emory University,Mary R. Galinski,,"This exploratory R21 proposal focuses on evaluating two Reticulocyte Binding-Like (RBL) protein vaccine candidates in rhesus monkeys with a blood-stage challenge to test for efficacy, providing for the first-time a proof of principle for this category of merozoite vaccine antigens, and also preparing P. vivax RBL antigens for future pre-clinical trials. 
Plasmodium knowlesi blood-stage infections in rhesus macaques become lethal 1-2 weeks after inoculation unless treated with anti-malarial drugs. We are proposing to test the potential of P. knowlesi RBL binding domains to function as immunogens that will attenuate the usual lethality of this parasite. If protection can be achieved against a conserved key biological target in monkeys, like the RBLs, there can be heightened confidence for advancing the homologous P. falciparum and P. vivax target(s) as a vaccine(s) in clinical trials. 
This project builds upon this group's discovery of the P. vivax Reticulocyte Binding Proteins (PvRBPs), the subsequent identification of these proteins in other species, (P. falciparum, P. cynomolgi, P. coatneyi, P. reichenowi, and P. knowlesi), and the identification and preparation as immunogens of two P. knowlesi RBL binding domains. The RBL proteins (also known as the reticulocyte-binding homologue (RH) protein superfamily) are located at the apical pole of merozoites, bind erythrocytes and are believed to be instrumental in directing merozoite invasion. Multiple rbl genes exist in each Plasmodium species (with only 2 in P. knowlesi, yet as many as 14 in P. yoelii), and data suggests that each species has maintained the ability to use one or another of the encoded ligands, or possibly combinations, as adhesion molecules to ensure entry into red blood cells. Critically, each species appears to have at least two RBLs that are essential for merozoite invasion. 
In Aim 1 using a rhesus monkey model we propose to test the hypothesis that immunization with an RBL red blood cell binding domain can limit a lethal infection, and that the combination of multiple RBL binding domain regions will provide greater protection. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that antisera to homologous binding domain regions from P. vivax RBL proteins will inhibit invasion of merozoites in vitro, as a prelude to possible pre-clinical vaccine trials using these proteins in NHPs. We will work to optimize the expression and purification of homologous binding domain regions from expressed P. vivax RBL proteins, characterize functionality (i.e. binding), develop and test the ability of these RBLs or specific antisera to inhibit invasion in vitro. Regardless of the outcome from vaccine testing, we will have gained knowledge and additional tools to study the RBLs as critical ligands for red blood cell invasion and as possible biological targets of intervention. 
PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A malaria vaccine would be extremely valuable tool to help control malaria. Novel approaches and new paradigms are needed that can expedite the testing and provide some form of validation for theoretically sound malaria vaccine candidates. This proposal is straightforward, while also being innovative, risky and exploratory. We will learn whether RBL-based malaria vaccines can provide protection against erythrocytic challenge and also develop valuable tools for advancing investigations relating to merozoite invasion of red blood cells. This research will also gain valuable information on the immune response to the RBLs and pave the way for potential pre- clinical malaria vaccine trials based on P. vivax RBL immunogens.

"Vaccination with purified, cryopreserved, infectious Plasmodium vivax sporozoites",http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8446961,Project,Apr-12,Mar-15,,$600 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,Sanaria,Stephen Lev Hoffman,,"Plasmodium vivax (Pv) is the 2nd most important human malaria parasite, causing >80 million cases annually. However, efforts to prevent and control Pv malaria face major challenges of drug resistance and repeated relapses from dormant forms. Moreover, Pv vaccine development has been impeded, because Pv parasites cannot be grown in continuous in vitro culture. 
Having manufactured the only purified, cryopreserved, vialed P. vivax (Pv) sporozoites (SPZ) in the world, and showed that these cryopreserved PvSPZ can be used to infect a chimpanzee and to infect hepatocytes in vitro, Sanaria is now poised to use these infectious PvSPZ as a first- ever whole parasite vaccine against Pv. 
The strategy capitalizes on the success of one of only two approaches that have ever induced long-lasting immunity against Pf malaria in humans, one using radiation-attenuated and the other using non-attenuated fully infectious SPZ with chloroquine. In a seminal paper it was shown that immunization by the bite of mosquitoes carrying fully infectious Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites (PfSPZ) of volunteers taking chloroquine induced 100% protective immunity, and protection was still present at 28 months after last immunization. Sanaria's unique technology platform has allowed an immediate translation of this observation with the manufacture of cryopreserved infectious PfSPZ (PfSPZ Challenge) that are fully infectious when administered by needle and syringe to humans, and trials involving infectious PfSPZ with chloroquine (PfSPZ CVac) are expected to begin in the U.S. and Europe in 2012. 
Conducting clinical trials of PvSPZ-CVac will require investment in development of a unique GMP manufacturing for PvSPZ. Prior to investing in such development, it would be useful to obtain proof of concept data for PvSPZ-CVac in an animal model. This can only be done in non-human primates, as PvSPZ do not infect any other animals. Therefore, before manufacturing cGMP-compliant material for clinical trials, we propose to assess the protective efficacy in Saimiri boliviensis monkeys of PvSPZ-CVac. We will first establish a minimum infective dose for cryopreserved PvSPZ and subsequently carry out immunogenicity and protective efficacy studies. Together the data generated will provide insight into the in vivo infectivity of our cryopreserved PvSPZ, the protective efficacy of PvSPZ-CVac, and the immune mechanisms of protection. They will potentially provide an immune correlate of protection that can be used in humans, and inform better design of an immunization regimen for a PvSPZ vaccine for humans

High Throughput Screens for Malaria Topoisomerases,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8417701,Project,Feb-11,Jan-15,,$1 100 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,University of Washington,Pradipsinh K. Rathod,,"Malaria parasites of the genus Plasmodium are responsible for 300-500 million cases of human malaria and cause about one million deaths every year. Resistance to all traditional antimalarial drugs, and early signs of weakening effectiveness of artimesinin-based drugs in SE Asia, further emphasizes a need for basic and translational research to identify new interventions to treat and to avoid malaria. 
The P. falciparum and the P. vivax parasite are single cellular pathogens with multiple compartmentalized genomes: The nuclear genome, the mitochondrial genome, and the apicolplast genome. The last is a chloroplast-like relict plastid that is essential for parasite survival. The survival and development of the parasite, in all its stages, is dependent on continual management of smooth unwinding, replication, and ligations of DNA molecules. These functions rely on topoismerase enzymes, which are known to be important targets of antimicrobial chemotherapy. The development of malaria topoisomerase inhibitors has been hampered by an inability to express the proteins in functional form. 
The Rathod laboratory has argued and shown that toxicity of malaria proteins in functional form can limit the ability of traditional heterologous expression systems, such as E. coli, to support expression of functional protein. We have used a cell-free wheat germ translation system to successfully express a number of malaria proteins in functional for, including the first P. falciparum topoisomerase II. 
In this project application, we will express all P. falciparum and P. vivax candidate topoisomerase and DNA gyrase gene products, test their catalytic activity, purify them to homogeneity, and develop miniaturized efficient assays for High Throughput Screening. 
These studies will set the stage for direct screening of chemical libraries to ultimately yield small molecules to prevent and to treat malaria.

Plasmodium Genus and PFV Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) Assay Kit,https://goo.gl/TtGK5Q,Project,Jul-03,Oct-15,United States,$885 321,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",NIAID 2014,,ID-FISH Technology Inc.,Jyotsna S. Shah,,"Malaria can be a life-threatening disease, especially in children, if left untreated. According to WHO, 525,000 to 2.0 million African children die from Malaria every year. The current gold standard for diagnosis is examination of Giemsa stained smear by microscopy. However, when parasite levels are very low, or in mixed infections, the information obtained by examination of Giemsa stained smear by microscopy is limited.
Under SBIR Phase II we have developed 3 kits, P-Genus, PF and PV FISH assay kits. These kits detect malaria parasites on blood smears prepared with a special reagent by Fluorescent in Situ Hybridization (FISH) technique, using specific fluorescent labeled DNA probes targeted to ribosomal RNA of viable parasites. P- Genus kit detects all species of Plasmodium. PF-FISH kit and PV-FISH kit detect and differentiate P. falciparum and P. vivax from other species of Plasmodium respectively, on any P-Genus screen positive blood sample. Since ribosomal RNA is the target, morphological information too is obtained. The assays are simple, semi-quantitative and detect all stages of the malaria parasites. The only requirement is a fluorescent microscope. We have validated a LED light unit with 2 filters that can be attached to a regular light microscope for reading the FISH assay results. The assays consist of six steps: smear preparation using proprietary reagent, fixation, hybridization, washing, counterstaining and viewing the processed smear under a fluorescent microscope. The total assay time is approximately 90 minutes. The limit of detection is between 2-3 parasites per 300 fields with 100X objective. Based on a study on 500 patients from Kenya, India and Peru with malaria- like symptoms, the sensitivity of the FISH assays was >95% whereas the sensitivity of Giemsa stained smear by microscopy was between 84 - 91%. In Phase IIB we will complete all the additional validation studies requested by FDA to file for 510(K).

Primaquine treatment will be allocated to study participants in a step-wise design; firstly receiving the current 14 day treatment regimen of 0.5 mg/kg total dose (n=40); secondly, a 7 day treatment regimen receiving a total dose of 1.0 mg/kg/day; then thirdly, receive 1.0 mg/kg twice daily dose (bd) for a total of 3.5 days, should the 7 day treatment prove to be safe and well tolerated. In addition to this dose-escalation study, the pharmacokinetic profiles of single doses of 0.5 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg will be determined using an intensive sampling protocol, in children aged 5-10 years. 
The pharmacokinetic profiles obtained by this sub-study will be essential for modeling the population pharmacokinetic data obtained from the dose-escalation study. As there is currently no data on the safety, tolerability and efficacy of primaquine in children, the present study will validate previous observation and contribute to the knowledge of primaquine as a treatment for liver stages of Plasmodium vivax infection

Pharmacokinetic and in Vitro Transmission Blocking Activities Study of Primaquine Compare to Methylene Blue in Healthy Volunteer Both G6PD Normal and G6PD Deficiency,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01668433,Project,Jul-13,Oct-14,Thailand,,,,University of Oxford,Mahidol University,Sasithon Pukrittayakamee,University of Oxford,"The emergence of partial artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum on the Cambodia-Thai border and more recently on the Myanmar-Thai border jeopardizes the renewed global efforts of control and elimination of malaria. Containment of this severe threat requires reduction of transmission of the resistant phenotype by adding gametocytocidal drugs to the treatment of falciparum malaria. Mathematical models also predict that transmission blocking will be required if the goal of malaria elimination is to be achieved. 
The only drug currently available with strong gametocytocidal properties against the more mature gametocytes is primaquine. However, the oxidative properties of primaquine readily causes acute haemolysis in glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, the degree of which appears to be inversely related to G6PD enzyme activity. Because of these safety concerns, primaquine is not widely deployed in treatment regimens for falciparum malaria, even in areas with documented artemisinin resistance. 
Methylene blue, which does not exert its action through an oxidative mechanism, is a promising alternative as a gametocytocidal adjuvant to artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs). Paul Ehrlich discovered methylene blue as the first synthetic drug ever to treat malaria. In contrast with primaquine, the thiazine dye methylene blue asserts its properties as an oxidizing agent only at very high doses, whereas at pharmacologic doses it has reducing agent properties and is for this reason used as a medication for the treatment of methemoglobinemia. A recent laboratory study identified methylene blue as a potent inhibitor of gametocyte development across all stages, almost fully abolishing P. falciparum transmission to mosquitoes at concentrations readily achievable in humans. In addition, a recent clinical study in 180 children with uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Burkina Faso showed that, compared to artesunate-amodiaquine alone, addition of the cheap drug methylene blue to either artesunate or amodiaquine importantly reduced gametocyte carrier rates measured at days 3, 7, and 14 of follow-up. This effect was seen both in patients with and without P. falciparum gametocytaemia at baseline. 
The current series of studies will investigate further methylene blue as a potential gametocytocidal drug in the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria

This trial re-evaluates the local efficacy and safety of DHA-Pip for P. falciparum and P. vivax infections.
Patients with uncomplicated malaria attending a public health care facility in Timika, Papua, Indonesia, who meet the study inclusion criteria will be enrolled, treated on site with DHA-Pip and followed up for 42 days. The follow-up will consist of a fixed schedule of check-up visits and corresponding clinical and laboratory examinations. On the basis of the results of these assessments, the patients will be classified as having therapeutic failure (early or late) or an adequate response. The proportion of patients experiencing therapeutic failure and drug related adverse events during the follow-up period will be used to estimate the efficacy and safety of the study drug. PCR analysis will be used to distinguish between a true recrudescence due to treatment failure and episodes of reinfection.
The outcome of the proposed project will have a direct impact on the decision making process of the Indonesian Ministry of Health on whether there is a need to alter the existing antimalarial treatment guidelines.

PQ was previously shown to clear gametocytes that persist after artemisinin-combination therapy. However, there are safety concerns about the use of PQ at the currently recommended dose of 0.75mg/kg in individuals who are glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficient. PQ causes transient but significant haemolysis in G6PD deficient individuals; this side-effect is dose dependent. There are indications that a lower dosing of PQ may effectively reduce gametocyte carriage but the lowest efficacious dose for gametocyte clearance is currently unknown. Recently, the World Health Organization changed their recommendation to a low dose of primaquine, 0.25mg/kg. However, there is no direct evidence on the extent to which (low dose) PQ prevents malaria transmission to mosquitoes and what the lowest efficacious dose is.
In the current study we aim to identify the lowest efficacious dose of PQ in individuals with normal G6PD function. Children with asymptomatic malaria and normal G6PD enzyme function will be randomized to treatment with artemether-lumefantrine alone or in combination with low doses of PQ. All enrolled individuals will receive a full three-day course of AL, and will be randomized to receive a dose of primaquine or placebo with their fifth dose of AL. Efficacy will be determined based on gametocyte carriage during follow-up, measured by molecular methods.

As control over Pf improves, Pv will assume increasingly larger percentages of malaria prevalence. The chronicity of Pv, due to the latent liver stage (hypnozoite) not eradicated by chloroquine, causes recurring disability and compounds the economic burden of those with symptomatic disease. The only widely available treatment for hypnozoites is primaquine, which, because of challenges with tolerability, safety in G6PD deficient persons, and compliance, is not commonly prescribed for the treatment of Pv. Currently, chloroquine is used for the treatment of the blood stages of Pv, however, there are concerns about increasing parasite resistance. Alternative treatments, such as artesunate, should be considered in the future of the treatment of blood stage Pv. The use of primaquine in the treatment of hypnozoites (radical cure) should be emphasized so that transmission of Pv can be controlled.
This study aims to determine the optimal primaquine regimen for radical cure of Plasmodium vivax. Chloroquine is currently the standard of treatment for Plasmodium vivax. Chloroquine may have synergistic effects when used with primaquine and due to its long half-life may delay the first relapse of vivax malaria. In contrast, artesunate does not have documented interactions with primaquine and has a very short half-life, thus, presumably will have no impact on first relapse. Combining primaquine with these two anti-malarials may lead to an alternative regimen for Pv infection and changing the primaquine dosing regimen may lead to a more practical and efficacious therapy

SPK Study in Afghanistan,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01707199,Project,Oct-12,Dec-13,Afghanistan,,,,"World Health Organization (WHO), University of Oxford","Ministry of Public Health, Afghanistan, Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit (MORU) ",Ghulam Rahim Awab,"World Health Organization (WHO), University of Oxford","Resistance to chloroquine was evident in Afghanistan by the late-1990s, with failure rates more than 60% for the country as a whole and as high as 90% for Jalalabad (Nangarhar province). The combination of artesunate with amodiaquine also proved to have low efficacy. In 2004 failure rates for SP for the treatment of P. falciparum were 10-15% consistent with comparable clinical data in Afghan refugees residing in Pakistan. Given this efficacy, the Ministry of Public Health, in consultation with WHO and other international partners, has implemented AS+SP as first-line treatment of slide confirmed P. falciparum malaria in Afghanistan. Quinine (7 days po) is second line treatment. CQ+SP has been the recommended treatment for patients with a presumptive diagnosis of malaria since 2003. Both artesunate and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine are safe and well tolerated drugs and there is no evidence of an interaction between them.
Artesunate (AS) has been reported to be associated with mild gastrointestinal disturbances, dizziness and tinnitus although none of these associations are convincing. The only potentially serious adverse effect that has been reported with the artemisinin class of drugs in clinical trials is type I hypersensitivity reactions (about 1:3,000 patients). Transient reticulocytopenia, neutropenia, and elevated liver enzyme values have been reported but none have been clinically significant. The weight of evidence suggests these drugs have no significant adverse cardiovascular effects. A variety of clinical, neurophysiological, and pathologic studies in humans have not shown evidence of neurological toxicity. Because these drugs have not been evaluated extensively in early pregnancy in humans, they should be avoided in patients in the first trimester of pregnancy with uncomplicated malaria until more information is available (WHO guidelines 2006).
Sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is a fixed combination of a long-acting sulfonamide and the antifolate pyrimethamine. These are synergistic against sensitive parasites. Minor adverse effects are unusual and serious sulfonamide toxicity is very unusual with a single-dose treatment of malaria. The anti-folate properties of pyrimethamine rarely produce toxicity.
The combination of AS + SP has been evaluated extensively in adults and children with uncomplicated malaria and is sufficiently efficacious in areas where 28-day cure rates with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine alone exceed 80%. This ACT is currently being used in parts of South America, the Middle East, and South Asia where SP susceptibility remains high. Studies conducted between 2004-2006 to evaluate the efficacy of artesunate plus sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS+SP) against P. falciparum showed high efficacy in terms of adequate clinical and parasitological response (Afghanistan National Malaria Strategic Plan).
The genetic determinants of in vitro resistance to the two drug components of SP individually are shown to be point mutations at seven sites in the dihydrofolate reductase gene (dhfr) causing resistance to pyrimethamine and five sites in the dihydropteroate synthase (dhps) gene causing resistance to sulphadoxine. Different combinations of mutations within each gene confer differing degrees of insensitivity. Due to administrative instability, until recently few molecular data relating to P. falciparum SP resistance markers have been available from within the borders of Afghanistan. However the investigators have obtained recent (submitted) data showing that in addition to two resistance polymorphisms in DHFR (C59R and S108N) that are well known to be at high frequency in the region, a small number of parasites in the Kunar province have three mutations (A437G, K540E and A581G) in DHPS.
This study is a prospective, open label, single arm clinical trial to test the PCR confirmed efficacy and tolerability of AS+SP for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria in Afghanistan. Follow-up will be for 42 days, in order to sensitively detect recrudescence. Recrudescence will be distinguished from re-infection by molecular techniques based on well characterized microsatellite markers msp1, msp2 and glurp will be used. Baseline and any recurrent parasites will be tested for DHFR and DHPS polymorphisms by RFLP as well as sequencing if indicated.

Estimating the Risk of Plasmodium Vivax Relapses in Afghanistan,https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01178021,Project,Jan-10,Dec-14,Afghanistan,,,,,"Ministry of Public Health, Afghanistan, Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit (MORU) ",Ghulam Rahim Awab,,"Globally more than 100 countries are endemic of malaria and about 60% of world population are at risk of getting the infection while around 10% are harboring malaria parasite in their blood stream. Of the four species of plasmodium that infect humans, Plasmodium vivax is responsible for 50% of all malaria cases outside Africa, and is endemic in the Middle East, Asia and Western Pacific, with a lower prevalence in Central and South America a common cause of malaria in many tropical and subtropical regions. Conventional control methods are rather inefficient for preventing transmission of this species of malaria. This is partly due to the persistence of the infectious reservoir, which take the form of latent hypnozoites in the liver, producing recurrent relapses and opportunities for new transmission for several years after initial infection.
Primaquine (PQ) is the only available drug regimen which can eliminate the persisting liver stages (hypnozoites) of P. vivax,but its use for 14 days is ineffective to prevent relapses at 15 mg daily dose (0.25mg/kg) in Southeast Asia and in Brazil, and at a higher dose of 22.5 mg daily in the Southwest Pacific. Due to high relapse rates, a primaquine regimen of 30 mg daily (0.5 mg/kg) for 14 d is now widely recommended for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) normal patients.
P. vivax is the predominant species in Pakistan and eastern Afghanistan. In this area G6PD deficiency is a common trait (7% in Pakistani and 14% in Afghan Pashtoon respectively). However facilities to test for G6PD deficiency are not available and hence routine administration of primaquine is not recommended in national guidelines because of the risk of severe haemolysis in those who cannot be tested.
Several national malaria programmes in Asia have adopted a truncated 5-day course of PQ for vivax malaria to reduce the risk of haemolysis to reasonable levels and to increases compliance rates. Recently this has been documented as being ineffective at reducing relapse rates amongst Afghan refugees in Pakistan while a supervised 14 day course can significantly reduce the frequency of second and third episodes of disease. This is also confirmed by a study in India. Use of the 14 day course is only recommended where the G6PD status of the individual is known, and, currently, where compliance with the full course can be assured. However supervision of patients for 14 day post presentation is seldom feasible in the majority of settings where vivax malaria predominates. Therefore the supposition that patients in a low literacy population will not comply with a 14 day course of treatment in the absence of supervision needs to be confirmed under normal operational conditions. Compliance in taking the drug cannot be monitored by direct observation or by chemical assay of residues in the blood because such interference may, in itself, affect compliance.
","This is an open label two-arm randomized prospective study of two treatments for P. vivax malaria. Patients meeting study inclusion criteria will be enrolled and allocated either chloroquine alone or chloroquine plus primaquine (0.25mg/kg/day for 14 days). Patients will be followed-up for 1 year, with clinical and laboratory examinations at each visit.

Study subjects
This study will require the involvement of two types of volunteers:
Parasite donors: 5-15 P. vivax-infected patients who will serve as parasites donors for experimental infection of mosquitoes, who will be enrolled in the endemic area.
Volunteers for immunization: Two other groups of volunteers will be immunized with the vaccine PvCSP. A group of 16 people without previous exposure to malaria (naive) and another 16 people with a history of previous malaria infection (pre-immune).
Methodology Recruitment of infected patients: Parasite donors will be recruited among P. vivax infected patients attending a diagnostic center in the endemic area.
Infection of mosquitoes Blood from donors will be used to feed three days old mosquitoes by artificial membrane feeding technique. At day 7 a sample of mosquitoes will be examined to determine the degree of infection by dissection of the mosquito gut. On day 14, a small amount of mosquitoes with a good degree of infectivity will be used to infect challenged volunteers.
Recruitment of pre-immune and naive volunteers: Volunteers for the immunization stage will be recruited both in the city of Cali, non-endemic region, and in Buenaventura, a malaria endemic region, through various activities such as conferences, meetings and other means approved by the IRB like posters and flyers.
Immunization: Volunteers will be immunized with the vaccine (n=16) or placebo (n=16).
Follow Up Volunteers will be under medical vigilance during the first hour following the immunization to detect any adverse reaction. After the first hour period a medical exam will be made. Eight hours after immunization, each volunteer will be telephoned to assess physical condition. Any adverse event (AE) will be registered.
Subsequent follow up will be made on the day next to immunization and 1 or 2 weeks before the next immunization by a new clinical evaluation and AE report. Volunteers will be educated to contact the research staff at any moment.
Infection of volunteers Immunized volunteers will be challenged on day ~150 of the study, 1 month after the third immunization by the bite of 3±1 infected mosquitos. The ""feeding cage"" will be placed on the forearm of a volunteer for 10 minutes, allowing that the feeding window, wich will be covered by a mesh surface be placed against the volunteer's skin.
Volunteers will be educated about the signs and symptoms of malaria and they will have a daily telephone contact during the first 6 days.
Between days 7 and 23 the volunteers will be asked to go to the Clinical Trials Unit daily in order to establish the presence or absence of disease through thick blood smear and samples will be collected for retrospective real time PCR P. vivax.
From day 23 until day 31, volunteers will receive physical and laboratory evaluation every other day and will have daily telephone contact.
Once the patients present signs and symptoms of the disease curative treatment will be immediately provided, and 15 ml of blood will be drawn, which will be used for immune response assessment.
If the volunteers do not develop the disease during the follow-up period, on day 31 they will be given antimalarial treatment.
Treatment Volunteers will be treated with antimalarial drugs approved by the Colombian Ministry of Social Protection: chloroquine (three (3) doses: 600 mg initially, followed by 450mg at 24, and 48 hours), associated with primaquine (30mg/día) for 14 days. All the volunteers will be asked to return two weeks after starting treatment for a thick blood smear test to ensure cure of malaria.

An artemisinin derivative combined with lumefantrine, amodiaquine or piperaquine is therefore recommended for the treatment of malaria in Africa. However, artemisinin resistance appears to be developing and resistance/tolerance to amodiaquine and lumefantrine exists. We are presently conducting a study in Guinea-Bissau. Preliminary data indicates that the effectiveness and availability of artemether-lumefantrine (AL), the 1st line drug, is poor. Consequently there is a need for another treatment option. Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) has been shown to be efficacious and well tolerated in several African countries and is therefore such an option. A clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine is therefore needed.
Parents to children seeking Bandim Health Centre (CSB) with symptoms compatible with malaria will be informed of the study.

Hobbs,,"Recent studies indicate that drugs used in HIV management can have antimalarial properties. In animal models, prophylactic doses of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMPSMX), an antibiotic commonly used as prophylaxis against opportunistic infections in HIVexposed and HIV-infected patients, have been shown to arrest liver stage development of malaria parasites. Indeed, the liver stage of malaria parasites may be important to target since it is during this stage that clinical symptoms are absent and fewer parasites are present. TMP-SMX, used in HIV-exposed and HIV-infected subjects for opportunistic infection prophylaxis, significantly reduces clinical malaria, even in areas of moderate to high transmission intensity and high antifolate drug resistance. It is possible that reduction in liver stage parasite burden contributes to this unexpected effect. Nonetheless, the contribution of this liver-stage parasite killing to the reduction in clinical malaria observed in patients receiving TMP-SMX remains undescribed. Our primary objective aims to answer whether TMP-SMX reduces liver stage malaria infection.
For our exploratory objectives, we are interested in TMP-SMX effects on the development of anti-infection malaria immunity and effects on transmission. In mice, TMP-SMX prophylaxis during repeated malaria exposures has been shown to induce protective, anti-infection immunity against malaria (Charlotte Hobbs, unpublished data), which is distinct from naturally acquired immunity in which, after multiple infections, patients have less severe disease. TMP-SMX impact on the development of malaria-specific immunity, however, requires further investigation. Also, TMP-SMX has been shown to have sporonticidal (mosquito-oocyst killing) activity at levels achieved in patients on TMP-SMX prophylaxis in susceptible strains of P. falciparum, but the effects of TMP-SMX on transmission in the field remain undescribed.
Assessment of TMP-SMX impact on liver stage malaria infection and the development of protective anti-infection immunity in children will help guide decisions regarding TMP-SMX prophylaxis duration for HIV-exposed children in malaria endemic areas.

It is highly effective with few adverse effects. The artemisinin component is combined with a partner drug with a longer half-life to ensure the clearance of the remaining parasites after rapid reduction by artemisinin.
ACT is used as first-line treatment for uncomplicated P. falciparum infection in Indonesia since 2004. There are 3 combinations available in the country including artesunate-amodiaquine (AS-AQ), dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PQ) and artemether-lumefantrine (AL). Studies at different sites across Indonesia have shown various efficacy. Yet, there is an increased concern of reduced susceptibility of P. falciparum to artemisinin in neighbouring countries. Therefore, there is a need to evaluate and monitor the efficacies of these combinations in Indonesia.
Molecular markers are an important tool for detecting and monitoring the presence of antimalarial resistance. Their significant implication is to geographically map the extent of resistant-parasites, thus enabling strategies for their control and elimination to be applied before the inevitably increase in the disease burden occurs. Different markers have been used to identify antimalarial resistance and recently a molecular marker for artemisinin susceptibility in P. falciparum has also been proposed. The presence of these markers in parasites from our study will also be investigated.

Enhancing vivax malaria research in Thailand,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8837935,Project,Oct-03,Dec-18,Thailand,$1 200 000,"Fogarty International Center (FIC), NIH",,Mahidol University,Pennsylvania State University,Liwang Cui,Mahidol University,"This proposal is the first renewal of our training program entitled ""Enhancing vivax malaria research in Thailand"" (D43TW006571). Plasmodium vivax is a highly prevalent, potentially dangerous, and most neglected tropical disease. It continues to cause a staggering 130-145 million clinical infections per year and accounts for the most malaria infections outside Africa. Recent studies have shown that vivax malaria is frequently associated with severe pathology. Yet, the first-line treatment for vivax malaria comprised of chloroquine and primaquine has remained unchanged for over 50 years and resistance to these drugs severely compromises their efficacy. Due to several unique biological features, P. vivax has shown extreme resilience to control efforts. It has become the most prevalent malaria parasite species in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) of Southeast Asia. 
Although countries within this region are motivated to embark on malaria elimination, the lack of effective control measures for vivax malaria hampers the achievement of this ambitious goal. As such, this training program will continue to address key knowledge gaps in vivax malaria research, focusing on three scientific areas. Specifically, we aim to understand the changing malaria epidemiology in the GMS, to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of drug resistance, and to advance the development of transmission blocking vaccines for effective interruption of vivax malaria transmission. 
This training program is a continuous collaboration between Pennsylvania State University and Mahidol University in Thailand. Within this program, mentors of diverse scientific disciplines will join forces to offer multidisciplinary training in innovativ approaches that address critical problems in the current malaria elimination campaign in this region. Based on training needs assessment, we want to expand our training efforts to include scientists from Myanmar, where malaria burden is the heaviest in this region. 
We propose to use a double-track mechanism: 1) long-term training of five junior faculty members, four postdoctoral fellows, and six PhD students, and 2) short-term training of endemic country scientists through annual short courses and workshops. The overall training paradigm designed in the renewal application will ensure that all trainees receive the required technical and intellectual expertise to conduct independent research on vivax malaria. In addition, this training program will serve as an important platform for the transfer of enabling technologies to endemic area scientists. By advancing the careers of these trainees, this program aims to build a critical mass of investigators and a necessary intellectual network in the GMS to focus on vivax malaria research.

For example >80% of human P. falciparum infections in sub-Saharan Africa contain multiple parasite genotypes. Most malaria species cannot be cultured in the laboratory, precluding culture based isolation of individual clones. Currently, genetic analysis of such complex infections involves either characterization of hypervariable genome regions or more recently, deep sequencing of infections. Both methods are inadequate because parasite haplotypes cannot be constructed and statistical methods for resolving complex haplotype mixtures are not yet available. 
To resolve this problem, we have developed robust methods for single cell genomics of Plasmodium, utilizing FACs to isolates single infected cells, followed by whole genome amplification, and genetic characterization and/or deep sequencing. These methods open up new opportunities for understanding the composition of complex malaria infections, for validating statistical methods that seek to reconstruct haplotypes from deep sequence data, and to examine the within host-dynamics of non-culturable malaria infections. 
We exploit these new methods: (1) to dissect the composition of P. falciparum infections in a region of intense transmission. These data will be used to determine how many independent genotypes are present, the relationships between the component haplotypes and their relative abundance within infections, and to critically evaluate the performance of indirect methods currently employed. (2) We will dissect complex P. vivax infections in Thai patients in primary and subsequent infections. This work is not possible through other means as unlike P. falciparum no long term culture is possible for P. vivax. We will clarify the relationships between primary and subsequent infections, and within host dynamics of this important human pathogen.

Evolutionary medicine in the development of antimalaria drugs,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8820233,Project,Mar-14,Feb-18,,$676 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,Jacobus Pharmaceutical Company,Harvard University,Daniel L. Hartl,Jacobus Pharmaceutical Company,"Evolutionary Medicine is the application of evolutionary thinking to problems in medicine and medical research. This approach has exceptional merit in infectious diseases, in which evolution is critically important in understanding virulence, immune evasion, drug resistance, and other features critical in public health and clinical intervention. 
This proposal takes an evolutionary approach to the evaluation of lead compounds for the development of third-generation triazine inhibitors of the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). DHFR is one of the most effective drug targets used for the prevention and treatment of malaria. 
The goal of this project is twofold: 
1. To apply evolutionary thinking to make informed choices of the best lead compounds to select for further development into clinically effective drugs with a long therapeutic lifetime
2. To perform the studies in such a way as to explore how adaptive landscapes of drug resistance change as a function of drug concentration and in response to differing perturbagens. 
In Specific Aim 1 we will examine the wildtype allele and all known naturally occurring polymorphisms in DHFR of P. falciparum and P. vivax for their resistance to five potential lead compounds for third-generation antifolates These tests will use both the yeast and bacterial transgenic DHFR expression systems. The use of experimental models is essential, as P. vivax cannot be cultured in the laboratory, and the production of the isogenic strains needed for the tests in P. falciparum is not feasible in regard to time or cost. 
In Specific Aim 2, we will augment the studies in Specific Aim 1 by creating the ""missing intermediate"" alleles to allow a complete combinatorial analysis of the adaptive landscape with respect to each of the novel triazine antifolates as perturbagens. 
In Specific Aim 3 we will carry out mutagenesis and selection experiments in the P. falciparum and P. vivax transgenic systems to determine whether the wildtype allele or any of the polymorphisms are easily converted via new mutations to resistance against any of the novel antifolates. This is a critical issue in evaluating the potential therapeutic lifetime of new drugs. The lead compounds to be tested are the five triazine antifolates WR99210, JPC-2067, JPC-2122, JPC-1058, and JPC-1054. 
The research will be carried out in collaboration with the Jacobus Pharmaceutical Company, a small company that is nevertheless a world leader in developing and producing antifolates against malaria and toxoplasmosis. Our collaborator, David P. Jacobus, MD has a distinguished track record of collaboration with academic researchers and open dissemination of research resources and information. 
The research is a unique combination of drug development and evolutionary biology with the potential to contribute to the development of new life-saving drugs while at the same time revealing new principles of protein evolution.

Golenbock,"International Centre of Medical Research and Training (CIDEIM), Colombia","Malaria remains a major cause of illness and death worldwide. Plasmodium vivax malaria is an especially important cause of morbidity in South America. Two major unresolved issues concerning the pathogenesis of P. vivax malaria are: 1) what molecules from the parasite activate the innate immune system and cause inflammation and, 2) what are the receptors that are ligated by these microbial products. 
Our studies suggest that Toll-like receptors (TLRs), acting primarily through the Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88 (MyD88) adaptor molecule, are critical for initiation of this early inflammatory response and pathogenesis of malaria. In addition, we have evidence of Nod-Like receptor (NLR) activation, inflammasome formation and processing of caspase- 1 in human patients during malaria. 
We hypothesize that upon P. vivax infection, innate immune receptors in phagocytes are responsible for the intense cytokinemia as a consequence of hyper-responsiveness of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and the assembly of inflammasomes. However, the most basic details of malaria-related cytokinemia are not well understood, although our studies in P. falciparum allow us to construct a hypothetical model of disease surrounding the delivery of parasite DNA to innate immune sensors. We further hypothesize that the innate immune response results in priming of the innate immune system which triggers the production of cytokines via phagocytosis of nucleic acids of via formation of immune complexes. 
We will evaluate (i) the levels of circulating parasite DNA, anti-nucleic acid antibodies, as well as immunocomplexes (ICs); (ii) the immunostimulatory activity of DNA-containing ICs on triggering cytokine production and caspase-1 activation via nucleic acid sensing innate immune receptors expressed by phagocytes; and (iii) as indicative of malaria priming, we will look for the expression of genes related to the TLRs, NLRs and IFN signaling pathway as well as the responsiveness of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients infected with P. vivax. Hence, we hope to define the contribution of ICs, pro-inflammatory priming, and inflammasomes on systemic inflammation observed during acute P. falciparum malaria. We hope to identify immunomarkers of disease, whose expression indicates checkpoints that are critical for the pathogenesis of P. vivax infection. 
Such knowledge should contribute to new insights on the molecular basis of inflammation during malaria and help to improve clinical management of malaria patients. 
Finally, this project will be done in collaboration with Dr. Carolina Gallego-Marin from CIDEIM (International Centre of Medical Research and Training) in Cali, Colombia, with the purpose of developing her career as an independent investigator in Colombia. The research will be performed primarily by the LMIC collaborator;initially 50% of the work will be done at CIDEIM and 50% in Massachusetts, and gradually the amount of time Dr. Gallego spends in South America will increase, with the ultimate goal of exporting cutting edge technology and expertise to the scientific community in Colombia.

Through this SC3 research, we will perform a comprehensive structure-based analysis of DHFR protein evolution in order to generate site-specific predictive models of likely amino acid replacements and identify locations where compensating amino acid replacements may be occurring in response to selection pressures.
Research will commence with generation of a comprehensive phylogenetic tree using DHFR protein sequences obtained from public domain databases. Ancestral sequences will be predicted for key clades in DHFR evolution. 3D homology models will then be generated for each of these ancestral sequences that will be added sequentially to an already existing structure-based sequence alignment generated from a superposition of experimentally determined x-ray crystal structures of wild-type (wt) DHFR from 22 species.
Predictive models of site-specific amino acid replacements will be generated using tools and techniques taken from the field of computational intelligence and machine learning that include HMMs and ANNs. These models will be tested and validated by using the first 70% of the phylogeny in order to predict the remaining 30%. Using the insights gained from these predictive models, an analysis will be performed with mutant DHFR sequences of P. falciparum and P. vivax to study the intraspecies differentiation that gave rise to drug resistance. Hypothetical DHFR sequences and homology models representing next steps in Plasmodium DHFR evolution will be generated. In silico docking experiments will be performed with existing anti-malarial drugs as well as known inhibitors of DHFR. Examination of the predicted protein-ligand interactions from these studies will provide additional insights into the acquisition of drug resistance.
Through this proposed effort, an innovative technology for studying and modeling DHFR protein evolution is realized. Predictive models of potential next steps in P. falciparum and P. vivax DHFR evolution will be generated as a proof of concept of this approach. This technology has far-reaching benefits including the generation of hypotheses for intraspecies differentiation and origins of drug resistance in P. falciparum and P. vivax as well as the ability to generate predictive models of future DHFR protein evolution providing the unique opportunity of getting a ""head start"" on drug discovery before drug resistance develops in the wild

The wider geographic distribution of P. vivax in comparison to P. falciparum is explained by the unique biological features of this parasite. Although the implementation of transmission control measures has had a significant impact on morbidity and mortality, the emergence and spread of drug-resistant parasites is a growing concern. The development of novel tools to control the disease is therefore a global priority.
This proposal wil build on our experience developing chimeric recombinant proteins and recombinant adenovirus vectors to develop a coadministration vaccination regimen that combines these two vaccine platforms. The overall goal of this research proposal is to simplify the immunization schedule by reducing the need for boosting at regular intervals. We will modify existing adenovirus vectors that express a Plasmodium multi-stage protective antigen as a transgene by insertion of a promiscuous T cell epitope within the capsid structure.
We hypothesize that the high copy number of T cell epitopes displayed by capsid incorporation will significantly enhance the immune responses to the chimeric transgene product. The optimized capsid modified vectors will then be used for coadministration with the multi- stage protective antigen expressed as recombinant protein.
The specific aims are to: 1. Characterize and compare the effect of the insertion of T cell epitopes within the capsid on the immunogenicity of recombinant adenovirus vectors. 2. Determine the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a coadministration regimen using the P. yoelii model. 3. Assess the immunogenicity of a coadministration regimen tailored for P. vivax. We will use adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) and the chimeric Ad5/3 vectors for capsid modification. Viable vectors will be used for comparative experiments in mice.
The successful outcome of comparative proof-of-principle experiments with the rodent malaria parasite will guide the design of a novel P. vivax vaccination regimen. We envision that our studies will provide valuable data to improve protective immune response induced by protein- based vaccines.

Transmission blocking vaccine study in Plasmodium vivax,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8667394,Project,Jun-12,May-17,,$386 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,China Medical University ,Yaming Cao,,"With improved financial and technical supports, many malaria endemic nations are once again considering a goal of malaria elimination. However, this ambitious goal is met with tremendous technical difficulties especially in regions where Plasmodium vivax is prevalent.
Interruption of malaria transmission worldwide has been recognized as one of the greatest challenges in malaria elimination. Vaccines that interrupt malaria transmission are ideally suited to this task. However, the progress in development of transmission blocking vaccines (TBVs) has been very slow. To date, we only have a few TBV immunogens with compelling evidence of transmission blocking activities.
For P. vivax, TBV studies lag even behind and only two post-fertilization antigens Pvs25 and Pvs28 have been studied. Therefore, this application targets the serious deficiency of knowledge about pre-fertilization stage antigens in the neglected P. vivax parasite using systematic approaches including antigen discovery in rodent malaria parasites, validation of transmission blocking activities in P. vivax, and development of novel vaccine delivery tools.
We aim to 1) identify new sexual stage antigens and evaluate their transmission blocking potentials in the rodent malaria parasite P. berghei; 2) validate known pre-fertilization TBV candidates and newly identified candidates using fresh P. vivax clinical isolates; and 3) improve transmission blocking activities of antigens by expressing the antigens in a baculovirus surface display system and by using a TBV combination strategy targeting both pre- and post-fertilization antigens simultaneously.
Results from these comprehensive studies will contribute to increased knowledge about TBV development, which is urgently needed for the ultimate elimination of vivax malaria.

SBIR Phase II: Broad-based Urine Test for the Diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax Malaria In Febrile Patients,http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1230453&HistoricalAwards=false,Project,Aug-12,Jul-15,,$571 000,US National Science Foundation (NSF),,,Fyodor Biotechnologies ,Edwin Agbo,,"This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop and validate a broad-based non-invasive, single-step Urine Malaria Test (UMT-Pf/Pv) for the clinical diagnosis of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and P. vivax (Pv) malaria, which account for ~800,000 deaths a year. Since malaria deaths occur within 48 hours of onset of symptoms, the ability to manage malaria at home or in village settings where most cases occur would (i) facilitate prompt access to antimalarial treatment, (ii) target treatment to those who need it, and (iii) reduce malaria mortality.
In this project, monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to novel poly-asparagine protein fragments identified in the urine of febrile malaria patients will be used to develop a UMT-Pf/Pv dipstick. The four overlapping specific aims are to (1) perform a detailed characterization of the diagnostic utility of MAbs developed in Phase I; (2) develop, test and optimize a prototype to meet design input specifications; (3) implement preliminary performance evaluation studies to evaluate sensitivity/specificity, and; (4)undertake preliminary clinical testing. As a non-invasive alternative to blood-based tests, the UMT-Pf/Pv could facilitate the delivery of rapid malaria diagnosis in settings across all geographical areas where malaria is endemic, markedly impacting the way malaria is diagnosed and treated worldwide.
The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the development of a broad-based one-step urine test for the home-based or point-of-care diagnosis of clinical Pf and/or Pv malaria in persons with fever. With the UMT-Pf/Pv dipstick, the number of steps that the operator is required to perform is significantly reduced, permitting greater utility, convenience and reliability in primary care settings. The test will also facilitate the effective integration of malaria RDTs into private sector malaria case management and encourage wider acceptability of clinical malaria diagnosis in endemic regions, especially in rural areas and in places where mixed infections frequently occur.
Overall, the test has the potential to markedly impact the way over 95% of all clinical malaria is diagnosed and treated, and drive current global efforts toward home-based or point-of-care testing for malaria prior to treatment in all cases of fever, as mandated by the World Health Organization. Since it is based on the same platform as current RDTs, this test can be easily integrated into current healthcare structures to provide significant benefits to public health in most endemic countries. No such test is currently available.

Chimeric hybrid transmission blocking vaccine for malaria,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8424202,Project,Feb-12,Jan-16,,$484 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,Emory University,Alberto Moreno,,"The overall goal of this R21 research proposal is to develop and evaluate the potential of a novel chimeric construct based on Pvs25 as an effective Plasmodium vivax transmission blocking vaccine (TBV). Given the emergence and spread of drug-resistant parasites, and the global malaria eradication agenda, the development of novel tools to control malaria transmission is an essential priority.
Plasmodium vivax is the most prevalent of the human malaria parasites outside Africa with an estimated 80% of the cases in South and Southeast Asia and 70% in the Americas. Although Pvs25 vaccine constructs have reached a phase of clinical development, a main concern in the field is its poor immunogenicity. Strategies used to date to enhance the immunogenicity include changes in the delivery system and formulation. However, a clinical trial using a water- in-oil emulsion was halted due to severe systemic adverse events. New methodologies to improve safety and immunogenicity of Pvs25 are required.
We have recently shown that the homospecific CD4+ help, provided by the genetic linkage of tandem Plasmodium promiscuous T cell epitopes to a merozoite vaccine candidate, improves efficacy by a direct effect on the quality of the antibody response. We hypothesized that this T helper module (HM) can be used as a carrier molecule to enhance the immunogenicity of Pvs25 and induce a robust transmission blocking immunity. We have genetically fused the synthetic gene encoding HM into a codon optimized synthetic gene encoding Pvs25. The hybrid gene has been successfully expressed in E. coli in a properly folded conformation.
The studies proposed aim to (1) test in comparative experiments in mice the effect of a HM on Pvs25 immunogenicity and (2) assess the safety and immunogenicity of the novel chimeric construct in rhesus macaques. Transmission blocking immunity will be tested in vivo using a P. berghei transgenic parasite expressing Pvs25 and in vitro using standard membrane-feeding assays. These studies have the general goal of showing that a HM can be used as a carrier platform for poorly immunogenic malaria antigens.
Given the dramatic impact of malaria with increasing attention on the widespread and severe nature of P. vivax, and the urgent need for novel control measures to reduce transmission, our proposal has the potential to serve as the framework for future development of effective multi-stage vaccines.

Five themes support these central goals. (1) Unstable transmission mapping needs to be radically improved to support hybridisation of traditional burden estimation techniques with geostatistical methods in these lower transmission but highly populous areas. (2) Stable transmission mapping must also be achieved and a large proportion of the proposal concerns the development of new Baye sian MBG cartographic procedures to provide continuous endemicity surfaces for P. vivax. (3) Clinical incidence mapping in areas of unstable and stable transmission will also be conducted to allow objective determination of the most precise method of burden estimation for each nation. (4) G6PD prevalence mapping is also required and, when combined in a Bayesian decision-support framework with the new P. vivax endemicity maps, will enable statistical evidenced-based primaquine treatment policy in both control and elimination contexts. (5) Basic reproductive number under control (Rc) mapping to support elimination cartography, will require substantial development of available mathematical models for P. vivax transmission. The biology of P. vivax, including its ability to relapse from liver stages, has consequences for mapping, burden estimation and modelling that will require innovative solutions.

Great Ape Reservoirs of Human Malaria,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8882754,Project,Sep-11,Jan-20,,$2 700 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,University of Pennsylvania,Beatrice H. Hahn,,"Of the five Plasmodium species known to infect humans, P. falciparum and P. vivax cause the most malaria cases worldwide, and thus pose the greatest public health challenge. Conducting comprehensive field studies, we discovered that both of these human pathogens have their origins in African apes (1-7).
We found that chimpanzees and gorillas harbor at least six Plasmodium species that are closely related to P. falciparum (comprising the Laverania subgenus) as well as parasites that are nearly identical to human P. vivax (1-7). Phylogenetic analysis of ape-derived sequences showed that P. falciparum evolved following a single host switch of a gorilla parasite (1, 6), while P. vivax emerged from within a Plasmodium species that infects both chimpanzees and gorillas (3). Although the origins of the human pathogens are now well established, nothing is known about the evolutionary and mechanistic processes that led to their emergence; yet, such information is critical to understand how ape parasites crossed the species barrier and whether such events are likely to occur again.
In this resubmission application, we propose to address these questions by characterizing the ape precursors of the human parasites at the whole genome level and by determining the species and host preferences of the Anopheles vectors that transmit these ape parasites. Our hypothesis is that comparative and population genomic studies of ape Plasmodium parasites, coupled with analyses of their transmitting mosquito vectors, will yield new insight into the biology of P. falciparum and P. vivax and reveal the processes that allowed ape parasites to colonize humans.
One major obstacle has been that ape Plasmodium samples are virtually impossible to obtain due to the endangered species status of their hosts. In the past grant period, we have solved this problem by developing a selective whole genome amplification (SWGA) technique that generates -- from unprocessed ape blood and fecal samples as well as infected mosquitoes -- sufficient numbers of parasite genomes for nextgen sequencing. Using this novel technology, we have already sequenced several near full-length ape Plasmodium genomes, which revealed a horizontal gene transfer in the precursor of P. falciparum (RH5 locus) and a new reticulocyte binding protein gene (RBP-3) in ape P. vivax.
We will use fecal and blood samples and infected mosquitoes to sequence the genomes of additional members of each of the six ape Laverania species (Aim #1) as well as chimpanzee and gorilla P. vivax parasites (Aim #2). Comparative genomic analyses will identify loci that are unique to ape versus human Plasmodium species as well as genes that have been subject to positive selection. These genetic studies will be complemented by field and laboratory studies of the Anopheles vectors that transmit ape Plasmodium parasites (Aim #3), as well as hypothesis driven mechanistic studies of host-parasite interactions (Aim #4). Execution of these aims will substantially advance our understanding of the pathways that led to the emergence of P. falciparum and P. vivax, and inform eradication efforts of future zoonotic risk.

Improving the radical cure of vivax malaria: A multicentre randomised comparison of short and long course primaquine regimens,http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/project/3FCD6803-8334-4A04-B596-3B0F6B49787A,Project,Jan-13,Dec-16,"Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, Indonesia",$4 370 110,"Medical Research Council (MRC), UK",,,University of Oxford,Ric Price,,"Plasmodium vivax malaria is a major cause of morbidity and an important contributor to mortality in poorly resourced endemic areas in Asia, South America and Africa. The greatest burden of vivax malaria is in South and Southeast Asia, where 2.85 billion people are at risk and experience 100 to 300 million cases of vivax malaria each year. Plasmodium vivax causes repetitive febrile illness associated with worsening anaemia particularly in young children and in pregnant women. Severe anaemia and low birth weight resulting in direct and indirect mortality.
Despite the very large population affected by vivax malaria and its socioeconomic burden, it has been and continues to be a neglected disease; global malaria R&D spending on combating P. vivax amounted to just 3% of total spending on malaria between 2007-2009. Since the 1950s chloroquine has been the mainstay of treatment for acute vivax malaria. However resistance to chloroquine was first reported in Papua, Indonesia and there is now good evidence that it is prevalent across the Indonesian archipelago and has spread throughout much of the vivax endemic world.
Unlike Plasmodium falciparum, P. vivax has in addition to the blood stage a liver stage of the parasite (known as hypnozoite) capable of reawakening weeks or even months after the primary infection. The complete treatment of vivax malaria requires administration of antimalarials to eradicate both the blood and liver stages of the parasite. Primaquine remains the only drug on the market for its liver stage activity. However the efficacy of primaquine resistance is difficult to determine due to variable relapsing patterns of P. vivax and the need for prolonged follow up to capture the late relapses. The widespread use of primaquine has been severely limited because of concerns regarding both its efficacy and safety. Primaquine causes haemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency, an inherited disorder occurring in 5-35% of patients in endemic zones. There a few readily available, affordable and reliable diagnostic tools for the rapid testing of GPD deficiency, and thus clinicians often reluctant to prescribe a therapy that is potentially harmful with limited perceived benefit. When it is prescribed adherence to the currently recommended 14 day treatment regimen is poor.
This proposal aims to provide critical evidence on the use of primaquine, a drug which is being increasingly recognised as a crucial tool in the global fight against malaria. We hypothesise that a shorter course high dose primaquine regimens will provide a practical approach to antirelapse therapy that is safe and effective. Our randomized placebo controlled multicentred trial will compare two different regimens of primaquine against schizontocidal treatment alone in 5 Asian countries. Trial centres will be established in South Asia (India, Pakistan and Afghanistan) where 70% of all cases occur and the interval between vivax relapses is relatively long, as well as two sites from South East Asia (Vietnam and Indonesia) where the interval between relapses is shorter and the risk of relapse greater.
The primary objective will be to compare two primaquine regimens giving the same total dose primaquine over either 7 or 14 days. Patients presenting with pure vivax malaria, meeting the inclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to receive one of the following three treatments: Option 1 - Standard blood schizontocidal therapy + 14 days of supervised primaquine (7mg/kg total dose). Option 2 - Standard blood schizontocidal therapy + 7 days of supervised primaquine (7mg/kg total dose). Option 3 - Standard schizontocidal therapy. Treatment with primaquine will be deferred until the end of the follow up period. This is the control regimen. Following treatment, patients will be followed for 12 months to monitor the number of vivax recurrences and the level of anaemia. Each recurrence of vivax malaria will be treated with the same allocated regimens.
Technical Summary: This is a multi-centre, open label, three-arm randomised non-inferiority trial to compare two primaquine anti-relapse regimens. The same total dose 7mg primaquine/kg will be given either over 14 or over 7 days. A control arm which receives only schizontocidal therapy without anti-relapse therapy will provide the comparison for safety, tolerability and relapse data. Once randomised into one treatment arm the subject will receive the same prescribed regimen for subsequent recurrent vivax episodes throughout the 12 months follow-up period. All potential study participants will be tested for G6PD deficiency. Patients identified as having G6PD deficiency will receive standard blood schizontocidal therapy plus 8 weeks of weekly primaquine dosing (7mg/kg total dose).

Leveraging RC-12 for Radical Cure of Plasmodium Vivax,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8608477,Project,Feb-13,Jan-15,,$372 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,University of Nebraska ,Jonathan L. Vennerstrom,,"There is good momentum in the discovery and development of drugs active against the blood stage of malaria, but new compounds active against other stages of malaria are sorely needed. As the goal of malaria eradication is now on center stage, new drugs active against the liver stage of malaria, most particularly the dormant hypnozoites of Plasmodium vivax and P. ovale will be required.
Our long-term goal is to leverage RC-12 to discover a new orally active single-dose antimalarial drug with high efficacy against hypnozoites and other exoerythrocytic stage parasites. The objective of this proposal, the first step in pursuit of this goal, is to identify the active metabolites of RC-12 that endow tis chemotype with its high efficacy in the 'gold-standard'hypnozoite animal model - P. cynomolgi-infected rhesus monkeys. Our central hypothesis is that species-specific metabolism accounts for the dichotomy between the high efficacy of RC-12 against P. cynomolgi hypnozoites in rhesus monkeys and the lack of efficacy of RC-12 against P. vivax hypnozoites in humans. This hypothesis arose on the basis of preliminary data produced in our laboratories.
The rationale that underlies this research is to provide tools to begin to elucidate the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) of RC-12 and to identify new leads (active metabolites) for drug discovery. To do so, and to test our central hypothesis, we propose the following three specific aims: 1) To synthesize the nine putative human, monkey, and rat RC-12 CYP450 metabolites to confirm their assigned structures;2) To establish a baseline metabolic and pharmacokinetic profile for RC-12;3) To assess RC-12 and its CYP450 metabolites for activity against P. cynomolgi hypnozoites in both rhesus and human hepatocytes.
Our approach is innovative because the metabolism and PK of RC-12 have never been studied and our proposed use of both rhesus and human hepatocytes will effectively dissect differences in host metabolism vs. protozoal species compound susceptibility without using P. vivax parasites. The expected outcomes from this work are as follows. First, we will achieve a thorough understanding of the CYP450 metabolism of RC-12. Second, we will identify one or more active metabolites of RC-12. Third, we will have, for the first time, generated PK data for RC-12. We assert that our proposed research is significant because it will provide the basis for the discovery of a new orally active antimalarial drug with high efficacy against P. vivax and P. ovale hypnozoites and other exoerythrocytic stage parasites informed by our knowledge of the PK/PD profile of RC-12.

Identification of the genetic basis of primaquine resistance in malaria parasites,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8793729,Project,Feb-13,Jan-16,,$159 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,"University of California, San Diego (UCSD)",Erika Lea Flannery,,"In 2009 approximately 225 million cases of malaria were reported resulting in 781,000 deaths, mostly in children under 5 years old. Of the 5 Plasmodium species that cause malaria, P. falciparum has the highest case fatality rate and is subsequently the most studied. This has resulted in a decrease in the prevalence of P. falciparum, yet in many of the countries where falciparum malaria has been eradicated, vivax malaria remains endemic.
P. vivax is the most geographically widespread of the Plasmodium spp., and over one-third of the world's population is at risk of infection. P. vivax is uniquely different from P. falciparum in that P. vivax is able to persist in a dormant, asymptomatic stage in the liver that can reemerge months to years after initial infection to cause clinical disease. These relapse episodes help to sustain transmission in endemic regions. Primaquine is the only licensed drug that will eliminate dormant liver-stage P. vivax parasites and thus prevent relapse. The development of resistance is a consistent hurdle faced when trying to control malaria and primaquine resistance has been reported. Despite being in use for over 50 years, the mechanism of action of primaquine is unknown.
The objective of this fellowship application is to identify the molecular determinants of primaquine resistance in Plasmodium spp. Identification of these determinants will inform the development of new antimalarials that target liver-stage P. vivax. To accomplish this objective, I will use an in vivo model to evolve primaquine resistance in Plasmodium parasites. P. vivax cannot be cultured in vitro, therefore I will use a rodent model of malaria, P. berghei. First I will develop a whole-genome sequencing approach to detect genetic polymorphisms in P. berghei. I will then evolve parasite resistance to primaquine by serial passage of blood stages of P. berghei in mice treated with increasing concentrations of primaquine. The whole-genome sequence of the starting evolution strain can then be compared with the resistance-evolved strain to determine genetic modifications that are associated with primaquine resistance. This resistant line can then be tested to see if it is also resistant in the liver stage by allowing mosquitoes infected with the resistant line to feed on mice treated with primaquine and subsequently see if a blood-stage infection develops.
Identification of the molecular determinants of primaquine resistance can then be used to establish molecular markers that can detect resistance in field isolates. These molecular determinants will also inform drug discovery efforts to identify additional liver-stage acting antimalarials. Both applications of the proposed results will aide in the eradication of vivax malaria.

This will require the efficient and accurate identification of residual transmission foci that can be specifically targeted for elimination.
Optimal surveillance systems should collect information on an ongoing basis to allow for a virtually real-time assessment of changes, while at the same time can be combined with other programmatic information to assist in planning, implementation, and modification/adjustment of malaria control activities to improve program performance. Whereas the current tools are not particularly suitable for this purpose, serological measurement, based on antibody prevalence, has been proposed as an alternative approach. Although this works well in areas of stable, low-level transmission, the vaccine antigens evaluated track changes in transmission very slowly and are thus of limited use in a rapidly changing environment where timely and actionable information is required.Thus there is an urgent need to identify a novel category of antigens with relatively short half-lives (6-8 weeks), and limited memory, for use in surveillance activitie. This need is particularly urgent for P. vivax, because well- characterized P. vivax candidate antigens are severely lacking. 
This study proposes to identify P. vivax proteins that can be used as antigens to screen for short half-life immune response, informing the recent history of parasite infection. Using multiplex bead assays, over 1,000 P. vivax proteins, produced by cell-free systems, will be screened against human plasma collected at different time intervals from P. vivax-infected subjects during clinical episodes and populations at risk in malaria endemic areas under a cohort epidemiological study with well-defined duration of new infection and post-treatment parasite clearance. The full kinetics profiles for antibodies to 100 selected antigens will be determined though analyzing the antibody titers at all time-points, to determine antibody half-lives. The 20 antigens with the best kinetic profiles (limited post-treatment antibody production, antibody half-life of 6-8 weeks, limited individual variation) will be selected for furher validation for use as surveillance candidate antigen to identify transmission hot-spots, using plasma from school-aged children in malaria-endemic and non-endemic areas. This study will result in the development of a novel serological assay to identify P. vivax transmission and its utility for detecting (residual) transmission 'hot-spots'among populations, and recent infections.

Annually, more than 300-400 million people worldwide develop malaria;each year, malaria kills ~800,000, primarily due to P. falciparum infecting children in sub-Saharan Africa. There is no highly effective, deployable malaria vaccine, and the prevalence of drug-resistant malaria is increasing throughout Africa, Asia and South America, which has been associated with an increase in morbidity and mortality. Even chloroquine-resistant P. vivax is emerging as a public health problem, mostly in Oceania but occasional cases have been reported elsewhere including in Peru. Alternative strategies for preventing and reducing the human burden of malaria are imperative.
A major challenge confronting the malaria field is how to apply advanced genomics-based knowledge towards the amelioration of malaria at both the field level and in the real world setting. This project will take such an approach towards understanding mechanisms of naturally acquired anti-malarial immunity in a low-transmission setting, lessons that may be generalizable to other regions.
The major hypothesis to be testing in this project is that asymptomatic parasitemia reflects clinical immunity to which complex interactions of antibody, memory B cells and helper CD4+ T cells contribute. Prior human studies clearly indicate that specific antibodies can mediate at least a reduction in parasitemia, and hence contribute to clinical immunity. This hypothesis will be tested in three Specific Aims: 1, To determine differential antibody responses of symptomatic vs. asymptomatic Plasmodium vivax malaria patients to asexual blood stage antigens;2, To quantify antigen-specific B cell and compare memory B cell phenotypes in symptomatic vs. asymptomatic P. vivax malaria patients;and 3, To compare and quantify antigen-specific CD4+ T cell responses in symptomatic vs. asymptomatic P. vivax malaria patients.
The implications of this study will extend to P. falciparum and to malaria immunity studies in multiple different contexts of malaria epidemiology and transmission, and provide the basis to extend and continue such work towards more effective malaria vaccine development in the future (i.e. towards research career independent, new R01 grant, etc.) RELEVANCE: This project will allow us to learn more about how people become immune to malaria. Studying patients with malaria due to Plasmodium vivax in the Amazon of Peru, we will compare people who have become immune to malaria after natural infection to people who are not immune. The results of this study will allow us to better design a vaccine to prevent and perhaps treat malaria.

African blacks or people with African ancestry are thought to be protected from Plasmodium vivax infection because their lack of Duffy antigen expression on the surface of the erythrocytes renders P. vivax unable to invade the erythrocytes.
However, recent studies challenge this conventional wisdom, raising the possibility that that some lineages of P. vivax may have evolved to use receptors other than Duffy for erythrocyte invasion. However, the epidemiological significance of vivax infection in Duffy-negative individuals is unknown. Furthermore, there is no information on the evolutionary history and infection diversity of P. vivax in Duffy-negative individuals.
In this application, we propose to examine the molecular epidemiology and population genetics of P. vivax in a vivax endemic area in Ethiopia. The two specific aims are: 1) to determine the prevalence of asymptomatic infections and the incidence of symptomatic malaria due to P. vivax in Duffy-negative and Duffy-positive individuals in vivax endemic Ethiopia, and 2) to determine the evolutionary history and genetic diversity of P. vivax isolates from Duffy-negative people. By determining the prevalence of asymptomatic infections and incidence of symptomatic infections in Duffy-negative and -positive individuals, we will be able to assess the level of protection from vivax infection conferred by Duffy negativity.
The findings from this study will have important implications on the vivax Duffy binding protein-based vaccine strategy against vivax infections, and significantly improve our understanding of vivax malaria distribution and transmission in a region of Africa that inhabited predominantly by Duffy-negative people. As our study sites have a large number of vivax cases, including many severe and cerebral cases and a large number of Duffy-negative individuals, they offer a unique opportunity to study the epidemiology and transmission of P. vivax in Africa.

In Aim 1, we will use amplicon deep sequencing to characterize the in-host diversity of initial and recurrent vivax infections in this cohort. Results will be combined with microsatellite genotyping, population genetic analysis, and statistical modeling to distinguish relapses from re-infections and identify genetic variants predisposed to relapse. We will then whole genome sequence parasites causing relapsing vs. non-relapsing infection in Aim 2 to search for genetic polymorphisms associated with relapse. Our overall hypothesis is that frequently relapsing parasites contain polymorphisms in sporozoite (pre-hypnozoite) specific genes that increase hypnozoite formation and confer increased relapse potential.

Madagascar P. vivax Invasion of Duffy-negative Red Cells,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8731173,Project,Sep-13,Aug-18,Madagascar,$1 400 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,Case Western Reserve University,Peter A. Zimmerman,,"Today at least 2.6 billion people live in areas of risk for Plasmodium vivax transmission;106 - 313 million cases of vivax malaria annually. While Duffy blood group negativity (Duffy (-)) has been considered to confer resistance to vivax malaria, our recent findings show that P. vivax has gained the capacity to infect erythrocytes and cause disease in Duffy (-) people in Madagascar.
Our surveys of school-aged children revealed P. vivax PCR-positivity in 8.8% of asymptomatic Duffy (-) children. We also observed mono-infection P. vivax clinical disease in 4.9% of Duffy (-) people who reported for treatment during in vivo drug efficacy surveys;blood smear diagnosis confirmed P. vivax. Interestingly, preliminary population studies using 6 unlinked microsatellite markers suggested that Duffy (-) infections were caused by multiple P. vivax strains.
While our results indicate that P. vivax invasion in Madagascar can occur independent of the erythrocyte's Duffy blood group antigen, we do not know if invasion is dependent or independent of the parasite's 'so-called'Duffy binding protein (PvDBP), the parasite ligand considered essential for invasion of human red blood cells. By DNA sequencing the PvDBP locus we have identified one allele to be over-represented in Duffy (-) infections.Additionally, recent whole genome sequencing has revealed that Malagasy P. vivax strains (and no P. vivax strains outside Madagascar) carry a PvDBP duplication. Overall, our findings suggest that P. vivax in Madagascar is evolving new erythrocyte infection mechanisms.
To begin understanding how P. vivax has gained capacity to infect Duffy(-) erythrocytes we propose to study population genetic features of the parasite population while performing in-depth cell and molecular biological analysis of P. vivax strains of Madagascar. Resulting data from these studies will allow us to address the following Specific Aims. Aim 1 - Determine associations between P. vivax strains and susceptibility of Duffy (-) people to P. vivax blood-stage infection and clinical malaria. Aim 2 - Assess interactions between P. vivax erythrocyte binding ligands and human erythrocytes that influence merozoite attachment and human red cell invasion. Aim 3 - Test alternative invasion pathways of Malagasy P. vivax strains in vitro for Duffy (-) and Duffy (+) erythrocytes.
Our studies will determine differential susceptibility of Duffy (+) and Duffy (-) people to P. vivax disease. Planne in vitro studies will provide insight regarding new P. vivax erythrocyte invasion mechanisms, with special emphasis on Duffy-independent invasion. Finally, we will determine whether molecular variations involved in P. vivax binding to, and invasion of Duffy (+) and Duffy (-) erythrocytes indicates capacity of Madagascar P. vivax strains to spread into other populations.

Dissecting Chloroquine Resistance in Plasmodium vivax ,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8803768,Project,Feb-14,Jan-16,,$442 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,University of North Carolina,Jonathan James Juliano,,"Despite the recent surge of interest in malaria, Plasmodium vivax has remained relatively neglected compared to falciparum malaria. Over 2.5 billion persons are at risk of vivax infection, which causes between 80 and 300 million cases per year. The principal drug in use today for vivax malaria is chloroquine (CQ) but its efficacy in now threatened by evolving resistance.
Over the past 20 years, CQ resistance emerged in Western Pacifica and Southeast (SE) Asia and is now spreading worldwide. In some countries, such as Cambodia and Indonesia, the diminished efficacy of CQ therapy has prompted a change to artemisinin combination therapies (ACTs), which are significantly more costly, as first-line therapy for vivax malaria.
The molecular basis of P. vivax CQ resistance remains unknown. Evidence indicates that the genetic events underlying P. vivax CQ resistance differs from P. falciparum as no association was found between in vivo drug responses and codon changes in Plasmodium vivax chloroquine resistance transporter (pvcrt), the P. vivax ortholog of Plasmodium falciparum chloroquine resistance transporter (pfcrt). Further research on CQ-resistant P. vivax has been severely hampered by the lack of critical tools to study the parasites including in vitro culture, DNA transfection and cloning methods. Therefore research on P. vivax CQ resistance depends on non-human primate models.
Recently, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) invested significant resources to generate the first P. vivax genetic cross between a CQ sensitive strain and a CQ resistant strain in a chimpanzee. Using this cross, our proposal is aimed at determining the genetic loci underlying CQ resistance in P. vivax by conducting a linkage group selection (LGS) analysis leveraging whole genome sequencing of parental strains and in vivo mixed progeny infections before and after drug pressure. Without the need for traditional clonal analysis and defined IC50s, LGS identifies shifts toward resistant parental alleles after selection with CQ indicative of genetic loci associated with CQ resistance and has been used to successfully identify resistance alleles/mutations multiple times in malaria rodent models.
This proposal is clearly significant for multiple reasons: 1) CQ resistant vivax is a major global public health problem causing significant morbidity and mortality with significant financial implications, 2) this will be the first genome-wide assessment for genetic loci of CQ resistance in vivax malaria using a defined genetic cross, 3) it leverages a set of samples from a unique and irreplaceable genetic cross generated in a chimpanzee, the approach which identified the key P. falciparum mutations for resistance to CQ and other antimalarials, 4) identification of CQ resistance mechanisms will aid in the development of additional antimalarials, and 5) identification of loci associated with CQ resistance will provide molecular markers of resistance, an important public health tool for studying the spread of resistance. The proposal is also innovative as it leverages new tools for conducting whole genome sequencing using hybrid capture to enrich parasite DNA and remove contaminating host DNA. Understanding the molecular basis for CQ resistance in P. vivax would be a major advance in understanding of vivax biology and has the potential to have profound impacts on global public health.

Modelling the contribution of relapse infections to the epidemiology and control of Plasmodium vivax malaria,http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/project/F17F55BE-FB6D-4274-8DA0-C8EBAE2B0E17,Project,Mar-14,Mar-17,,$499 104,"Medical Research Council (MRC), UK","£300,098 GBP",,Imperial College London,Michael White,,"Plasmodium vivax is the most widely distributed species of malaria across the world, with almost 3 billion people living in at-risk countries, and an estimated 100 - 400 million clinical cases every year, mostly in Asia and South America. Despite the enormous burden to public health, research into P. vivax is neglected compared to P. falciparum (the parasite species responsible for the majority of cases of malaria in Africa).
A key feature of P. vivax malaria not seen in all forms of malaria is the occurrence of relapse infections, where infected individuals become re-infected weeks to months after recovering from their initial infection. This is a phenomenon occasionally seen in British and European travellers returning from Asia and South America. Despite taking daily anti-malarial tablets during their trip, some travellers suffer relapse infections upon their return and may experience a potentially fatal episode of clinical malaria, often up to a year later. In contrast, relapse infections are a regular occurrence for people living in countries with P. vivax malaria. However in practice, in regions of the world where P. vivax is continuously transmitted it is difficult to distinguish these relapses from new infections arising from mosquito bites. Relapse infections arise from P. vivax parasites that lie dormant in the liver and re-activate at a later date. The triggers for relapse infections are still poorly understood, with explanations ranging from fever due to other diseases, exposure to subsequent mosquito bites, and a biological clock for relapse infections.
In this project, I aim to explore what causes infections to relapse by using simulation models to analyse data from approximately 4,000 people exposed to P. vivax infection in trials in Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Thailand and Brazil. With an understanding of how infections relapse, I will develop a simulation model of how P. vivax is transmitted between humans and mosquitoes, and use this to investigate how scaling up malaria control interventions can be used to control or eliminate P. vivax from endemic countries. P. vivax can be prevented by using insecticide treated nets to kill infected mosquitoes, or anti-malarial drugs to kill the parasites inside humans. Most anti-malarial drugs only target blood-stage infection and leave parasites in the liver untouched. A notable exception is primaquine which targets both parasites in the blood and dormant parasites in the liver.
A century of experience of malaria control has shown that drug treatment and vector control reduce cases of P. vivax malaria, however the impact of these interventions on population level transmission has been difficult to predict. I will use a simulation model of the transmission of P. vivax to compare how treatment programmes with drugs targeting different stages in the parasite's lifecycle can protect the infected individual, and the wider community by preventing onward transmission. Insights from these models will contribute to the evidence base required to choose optimal combinations of malaria control interventions as national malaria control programmes strive for increased P. vivax control and in some cases, elimination.
Technical Summary Following a bite from a P. vivax infectious mosquito, sporozoites inoculated into the skin migrate to the liver, where they develop to cause blood-stage infection, or transform into hypnozoites, a stage of the parasite that lies dormant in the liver. Hypnozoites re-activate weeks to months later and cause P. vivax relapses. Recent advances in genotyping markers for molecular monitoring have enabled investigation of the genetic diversity and multiplicity of P. vivax infections, allowing relapses to be distinguished from new infections. I will use data on genotyped infections from approximately 4,000 participants in longitudinal studies to estimate the contributions of new and relapse infections. These estimates will be combined with epidemiological data to test hypotheses for the determinants of hypnozoite activation, ranging from febrile illness, exposure to Anopheles proteins, to a seasonally-driven biological clock for activation. I will construct statistical models of P. vivax relapses and fit them to data from treatment-reinfection studies to estimate key parameters describing relapses: (i) the proportion of infections due to relapses; (ii) the frequency of relapse infections; and (iii) the period during which a person is at risk of relapsing after primary infection. Models of relapse infections will be embedded within a transmission model of the P. vivax lifecycle. This will be fitted to data on age and exposure-specific patterns of parasite prevalence and clinical incidence using Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods incorporating prior biological knowledge. Using this model, I will estimate the public health benefit of malaria control interventions. I will develop models for the effects of primaquine treatment (the only available drug that can clear hypnozoites), to compare different treatment strategies, from the perspective of an individual receiving treatment, and from a population-level perspective incorporating reductions in transmission.
","The aims of this project are to develop biologically-motivated mathematical models to investigate the effect of relapse infections on the transmission dynamics of P.vivax and identify opportunities for reducing the burden of P.vivax associated morbidity and mortality through the scale up of malaria control interventions. This will be achieved through:
1. Development of a model of the proportion of P.vivax infections attributable to relapses, and the frequency and duration of relapses;
2. Embeddig a model of relapse infections within a mathematical model of the P.vivax lifecycle to investigate the parasite?s transmission dynamics;
3. Using the transmission model to estimate the population level public health benefits of combinations of malaria control interventions.",Modelling,P. vivax
Strain-specific Immunity to Plasmodium vivax malaria,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8542980,Project,Jul-14,Jun-18,,,,,,Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center,Christopher L. King,,"Plasmodium vivax malaria contributes to a large burden of malaria morbidity owing to its widespread global distribution, the increasing prevalence of drug-resistant strains and most importantly, infections with Pv cause severe clinical syndromes. Plasmodium vivax accounts for 12.4% of infections acquired in Africa and 70-90% of infections acquired in Asia and the Americas. More cases of Pv are now reported than any other malaria species for active duty or returning soldiers. Because of increasing drug resistance to Pv, lethal cases and replapsing behavior of Pv, development of Pv vaccine is a major priority of the Military Infectious Disease Research Program. 
One of the leading Pv vaccine candidates is P. vivax Duffy binding protein region II (PvDBPII). This protein is expressed at the parasite's cellular surface and binds the host red cell's Duffy antigen (Fy) that facilitates erythrocyte invasion. Other human malaria such as P. falciparum, have several different Duffy Binding Protein-like genes that facilitate the use of alternative receptors for merozoite invasion, however the almost exclusive dependence of PvDBPII and Duffy antigen for Pv invasion of erythrocytes a critical weakness and makes the Pv DBP ligand an ideal target for vaccine development. 
Substantial challenges remain for use PvDBPII as a vaccine, including its high degree of polymorphism, its weak immunogenicity and a lack of understanding as regards to the specific portion of the molecule engendering the strongest blocking or protective responses. 
This proposal builds on observations from our current project. First, we have identified a subset of individuals in endemic areas who acquire high titers of functional antibodies described above that block binding to multiple PvDBPII variants. Mapping of the functional human Abs to specific regions of PvDBPII may help to identify a strain-transcending vaccine. Second, polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies generated in different animals that block binding of PvDBPII to Fy preferentially recognize a relatively conserved sub-domain of PvDBPII that could facilitate development of a vaccine. Third, we have shown that the major polymorphism in Fy (Fyb Fya, Asp42Gly) is associated with both diminished binding of PvDBPII and a reduced risk of clinical Pv in humans. We found that both naturally acquired and artificially induced Abs directed to PvDBPII more effectively blocked its binding to Fya as compared to Fyb erythrocytes, indicating host Fy genotype may be important vaccine efficacy. 
Aim 1. To identify epitopes on PvDBPII recognized by strain-transcending neutralizing antibodies. Aim 2. To develop vaccine approaches to elicit strain-transcending blocking/invasion inhibitory antibodies to PvDBPII. Aim 3. To determine the role of the Duffy Fya as compared to Fyb phenotype in functional immune responses to PvDBPII in vitro and in vivo.

Midgut Transcriptome and Proteome Analyses: Non-model Anopheline Malaria Vectors,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8700629,Project,Jul-14,Jun-16,,$214 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (JHBSPH),Rhoel David Ramos Dinglasan,,"Development of Plasmodium parasites in the Anopheles mosquito is required for successful malaria parasite transmission. Although the greatest burden of disease occurs in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), malaria morbidity and mortality extends far beyond the African continent. Across the geographical distribution of known anopheline vectors of Plasmodium, morbidity and mortality are caused by both Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax. In fact, P. vivax has the widest geographic distribution with 2.5 billion people at risk of the disease, and between 80 - 300 million clinical cases every year, including severe disease and death. Despite this tremendous public health burden, P. vivax research has received far less attention and support than efforts centered on P. falciparum. 
There is a recent heightened re-emphasis on studies aimed at elucidating the transmission biology of P. vivax. Unfortunately, little molecular and genome-scale information exists for vectors of P. vivax, which in some endemic regions outside of SSA are also vectors of P. falciparum. Moreover, although the molecular functions of the genome of the ""model"" African P. falciparum vector, Anopheles gambiae is relatively well studied, the substantial evolutionary divergence observed within anophelines limits its utility as the reference for the entire lineage, especially with respect to several P. vivax vectors. 
One of the major vectors of P. vivax and P. falciparum, and a potentially great emerging model system to understand the transmission biology of human Plasmodia through mosquitoes, is Anopheles farauti 1 (FAR1/AF1) and related species complex members in the Western Pacific. To better understand malaria transmission biology, it is imperative to more thoroughly examine the interaction between the parasite and mosquito tissues, particularly the mosquito midgut. 
In this project our overarching question is ""What are the molecular determinants mediating Plasmodium ookinete-Anopheles midgut interactions?"" Thus, we will perform comparative transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of mosquito midgut lumen expressed immune- related genes from the model (gambiae), the recently sequenced ""emerging model"" anopheline vector (FAR1) colony and wild-type farauti (AF1) mosquitoes, as well as the non-model but related species (An. punctulatus, AP). 
Our focus will be on the subset of immune-related genes that are differentially expressed as both transcript and protein in response to blood feeding and Plasmodium invasion. We will first focus on FAR1 infections with laboratory P. falciparum and complement these studies with subsequent P. vivax membrane feeding assays with FAR1/AF1/AP. It should be noted that the transcriptome assembly and proteomics analysis of the FAR1/AF1 mosquito midgut described in this project will not only strongly complement and enhance the vector-biology community's recent FAR1 sequencing effort and genome annotation for this species but will also greatly contribute to bringing our knowledge on vivax-anopheles interactions on par with that of falciparum-gambiae, thus allowing the two study systems to ""reciprocally illuminate"" one another.

Multivalent chimeric subunit malaria vaccines,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8837779,Project,Mar-15,Feb-20,,$494 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,Drexel University,James Matthew Burns,,"Despite recent successes of various mosquito vector control and antimalarial drug programs in many endemic areas, malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax remains a major global public health problem. The development of an efficacious vaccine could greatly enhance efforts to reduce the malaria burden. However, results from a number of clinical trials, including the current phase III trial of the pre- erythrocytic stage vaccine, RTS,S have not been encouraging. 
While there are several challenges that must be addressed, two key issues have repeatedly emerged. First, the immunogenicity of subunit vaccines must be improved. Second, there is no indication that immunity to these complex, multi-stage plasmodial parasites is directed toward a single protective antigen. Vaccine candidate antigens will need to be formulated in combination, without any reduction in the immunogenicity of individual components. 
This project focuses on vaccine targets where antibody-dependent mechanisms of immunity are essential, but where immunogenicity of neutralizing B cell epitopes has not been optimal. In proof-of-concept studies, we overcome obstacles related to both production and suboptimal immunogenicity of recombinant antigen based vaccines by engineering a well-conserved, highly immunogenic, P. falciparum specific carrier protein that induces potent CD4+ T cell help for the production of neutralizing antibodies. Genetic fusion of neutralizing B cell epitopes of P. falciparum to a parasite specific carrier protein will also allow concurrent boosting of vaccine-primed B cells and vaccine-primed CD4+ T cells by natural P. falciparum infection. 
In this project, we will systematically evaluate 4 leading vaccine candidates to define highly efficacious, multi-antigen formulations and link antibody specificity and isotype with functional assays of parasite neutralization. We will express and purify recombinant merozoite surface protein 2, reticulocyte-binding protein homologue 5 and the 25 kDa sexual stage antigen of P. falciparum, each as a single antigen and as a chimeric fusion protein with the rPfMSP8 (?Asn/Asp) carrier. We will compare the immunogenicity of single versus chimeric antigen vaccines formulated with Th1/Th2 biasing adjuvants with respect to antibody titer, isotype and activity in functional assays of parasite neutralization. In mice and non-human primates, we will test three, highly immunogenic recombinant vaccines in combined formulations with rPfMSP1/8, a chimeric MSP-based vaccine shown to elicit high titers of growth inhibitory antibodies. 
Success in this effort would 1) represent a major step toward the goal of producing a combined blood-stage/sexual stage malaria vaccine to concurrently reduce the severity of clinical disease and block transmission and 2) provide a solid foundation for subsequent safety and immunogenicity testing in human subjects.

Optimization of chimeric multi-stage immunogens for malaria vaccine development,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8880440,Project,Jul-14,Jun-15,,$844 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,Emory University,Alberto Moreno,,"Malaria is one of the most widespread infectious diseases, prevalent in over 100 countries worldwide. Half of the human population is living in areas with risk of transmission. Plasmodium vivax is the most prevalent of the human malaria parasites outside Africa with an estimated 80% of the cases in South and Southeast Asia and 70% in the Americas. According to the World Health Organization malaria parasites are responsible for over 3% of the years of life lost. The economic impact is also enormous with an estimated average loss of 1.3% of annual economic growth in high transmission areas. The development of effective vaccines, anti-malaria drugs and the implementation of anti-vector measures are global health priorities to control the disease. 
The overall goal of this research proposal is to develop an effective multi-stage P. vivax vaccine. We have recently shown that a hybrid protein vaccine designed by genetic fusion of pre-erythrocytic and erythrocytic stage components induced a robust protective immune response in a very sensitive rodent system. Functional antibodies and CD4+ T cells are required for protection. We have also used a novel chimeric adenovirus vector to deliver such protective antigen and have confirmed that heterologous immunization regimens enhanced vaccine potency. The corresponding orthologous sequences in P. vivax have also been expressed as chimeric recombinant proteins. A critical biological feature of P. vivax is the development of dormant forms in the liver that cause subsequent blood infections known as relapses. 
We hypothesize that the multi-stage P. vivax vaccine proposed here will have a significant impact on malaria relapses. To test this hypothesis, we will conduct in vitro and in vivo studies with P. cynomolgi, a simian malaria parasite that reproduces the biological and clinical features of the human parasite P. vivax. The studies proposed are aimed at: (1) developing multi-stage P. cynomolgi experimental vaccine constructs, (2) assessing the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of the P. cynomolgi multi-stage constructs in rhesus macaques and (3) optimizing a P. vivax multi-stage vaccine candidate and evaluating efficacy in non-human primates (Saimiri boliviensis). 
This rigorous testing, using two unique and complementary non-human primate models, will determine if the approach is promising and will offer the potential for subsequent clinical pathway development. Given the dramatic impact of malaria with increasing attention on the widespread and severe nature of P. vivax and the urgent need of novel control measures, our proposal is both significant and timely.

Defining epitopes of Plasmodium vivax RBP that are potential vaccine targets,http://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?aid=8770787,Project,Aug-14,Jul-16,,$224 000,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), NIH",,,University of South Florida,Francis Babila Ntumngia,,"Plasmodium vivax is the leading cause of malaria outside of Africa, with over 100 million clinical cases annually. Increasing reports of clinical severity of vivax malaria due to emergence of more virulent and drug resistance forms of the parasite, the ability of the parasite to undergo relapse in the liver and the strain specific nature of the immunity to P. vivax infections has contributed in making control more difficult. There is therefore an urgent need for a vaccine to control the disease. 
Merozoite invasion of human erythrocytes is essential for blood stage development of malaria parasites. P. vivax has a selective preference for infecting reticulocytes, a process mediated by the reticulocyte binding proteins (RBPs), which target reticulocytes for invasion. This essential role in the invasion process makes RBPs ideal targets for vaccine development induced against blood stage P. vivax. 
We hypothesize that an effective RBP based vaccine will require targeting the functionally conserved receptor-binding domains of multiple RBPs. The large size of the RBPs makes it difficult to produce correctly refolded recombinant proteins using the traditional expression systems. Refolded proteins may surfer from poor immunogenicity due to ineffective presentation of protective epitopes. Thus, it is difficult to induce a strong, high-titer response to all potential epitopes. Usually, immunodominant epitopes, which in most part are polymorphic, do not necessarily correspond to the most effective neutralizing epitopes. 
This project will define the immunological properties of P. vivax reticulocyte protein 1 (PvRBP1), and identify functionally conserved epitopes that are correlates of protective immunity. The native conformation of RBP1 epitopes from the P. vivax Sal1 strain will be recreated in vitro as recombinant proteins expressed by virus-like particles (VLPs) of the RNA bacteriophage MS2. Broadly neutralizing anti-RBP inhibitory immune sera and/or monoclonal antibodies raised against recombinant fragments of RBP1 will be used to screen MS2 phage libraries displaying fragments of RBP1 or random peptides on VLPs to define target epitopes of these neutralizing antibodies. The immunogenicity of the selected VLP targets will be evaluated by immunization of laboratory animals and the vaccine potential of these targets will be evaluated by the ability of epitope-specific antibodies to inhibit RBP-reticulocyte binding of allelic RBP variants, recognition of the native protein on the parasite by IFA and immunoblot and anti-parasite activity in short-term in vitro cultures. 
It is expected that a sub-unit vaccine based on defined protective epitopes expressed on the VLP surface will induce a stronger immune response to potential neutralizing epitopes on RBP than recombinant antigens. The development of an effective malaria vaccine will be an important tool to complement the existing malaria prevention strategies including reduction in parasitemia, prevention of clinical symptoms and the overall disease burden.

The Plasmodium vivax counterpart Pvs 48/45 is likewise expected to be an important vaccine candidate. In spite of significant sequence identify and presumed conserved biological function not much is known about the transmission blocking efficacy of antibodies against Pvs48/45 and if it will be similar to functional antibodies against Pfs48/45 as no cross-blocking reactivity has been observed. 
Several impediments to developing a transmission blocking vaccine for P. vivax malaria have delayed progress for this long term goal. These have included availability of conformationally suitable recombinant protein, lack of an in vivo challenge model and the inability to produce P. vivax gametocytes in the lab to test biological function of antibodies. 
In this application, we propose to develop certain much needed reagents to move the field forward capitalizing on success with Pfs48/45 in the co-investigator's lab. In Aim 1 we propose to generate monoclonal antibodies directed against Pvs48/45 and characterize their binding parameters and functionality through in vitro membrane feeding assays. Aim 2 will focus on examining the polymorphisms of Pvs48/45 in natural isolates and identification of epitopes recognized by antibodies elicited by natural infection. The third aim will determine the functional domains in Pvs48/45 using fragments of the protein to identify protein domains involved in forming conformational epitopes of relevance to transmission. The development of the mAb reagents against Pvs48/45 will greatly aid in understanding the biology of the protein and assist in the development of a transmission blocking vaccine based on Pvs48/45 for P. vivax malaria. 
While the objectives of the proposed work may appear routine, the generation of these reagents and characterization of epitopes are critical for more significant gains as discussed above as well as use of mAbs with transmission blocking potential in developing and establishing a murine model based on transgenic parasites (which is outside the scope of this application).

Vivax malaria is known to incapacitate individuals of all ages resulting in repeated febrile episodes, severe anemia, respiratory distress and poor outcomes in pregnancy. 
Exclusion of P. vivax from much of Africa is associated with high prevalence of Duffy blood group negativity while the parasite's strong preference for reticulocytes has limited our ability to conduct experimental research in the laboratory. Both of these biological characteristics can be attributed to ligands expressed by invasive blood-stage merozoites. Humoral immunity to P. vivax invasion ligands is believed to play a critical role in controlling the blood-stage infection thereby limiting clinical disease. Therefore, the Duffy binding protein, which binds its cognate receptor the Duffy blood group antigen, has become a leading candidate against vivax malaria with the primary focus on the cysteine-rich ligand domain, or region II (DBPII). The major obstacle for developing this antigen as an effective vaccine is its high degree of polymorphism within the receptor-binding site that makes ineffective the weak strain-specific immunity that typically results from infection.
We hypothesize that dominant B-cell epitopes of DBPII are polymorphic as an evasion mechanism that diverts the immune response away from the more conserved, functionally important neutralizing epitopes similar to other microbial ligands. Data generated from our initial funding period supported this underlying hypothesis that guide our project and the methodological approaches pursued. The specific aims will define the immunological properties of DBPII and identify functionally conserved determinants that are targets of strain-transcending inhibitory antibodies. Our long-term goal is to optimize efficacy of DBPII as a broadly effective vaccine that elicits antibodies to conserved strain-transcending neutralizing epitopes.

Overall efficacy of these vaccines is evaluated by measuring reduction of infection and clinical cases among vaccinees and the parasite infectivity to mosquitoes, (human-to-mosquito transmissibility), before and after vaccination, and with or without vaccination. One of the candidate VIMTs, the PfSPZ Vaccine, is currently being tested in Mali for safety, tolerance, and immunogenicity.

The efficacy of non-pyrethroid insecticide-treated durable wall liners as a method for malaria control in endemic rural Tanzania: cluster randomized trial,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT02533336?cond=%22Malaria%22,Project,Jul-13,Aug-16,"Tanzania, United Republic of",$1 576 771,President's Malaria Initiative (PMI),,"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), USA","National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR), Tanzania, Kilimanjaro Christian Medical University College, Tanzania","Franklin Mosha , William N. Kisinza","Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), USA","Vector control, together with prompt treatment with an artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for individuals diagnosed with malaria and intermittent preventive treatment in pregnant women, is a critical component of malaria control in Africa. The two main vector control interventions used in Africa are long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS). LLINs are currently the mainstay of vector control and are believed to have contributed to the recent dramatic decline in malaria cases. However, resistance to the pyrethroid insecticides used in the bed nets has increased. The second main vector control method, IRS, has been an extremely effective adjunct to LLINs; its usefulness is threatened by the high cost of repeated applications and increasing mosquito resistance to insecticides used for spraying.
A new product, durable lining (DL) treated with non-pyrethroid insecticides, has been developed by Vestergaard, which theoretically mimics the effect of IRS but is designed to last for a minimum of three years. The product consists of a mixture of two non-pyrethroid insecticides incorporated into a polymer fabric that are designed to migrate differentially over the lifetime of the product to ensure sustained bioefficacy. The use of two agents may also decrease the risk of development of resistance. It is estimated that the cost of the insecticide treated wall liners (DL), which are installed on the indoor walls of houses, would be equal to 2-3 rounds of IRS.
To test the effectiveness of this new product, we will conduct a two-arm controlled randomized cluster trial to test the hypothesis that DL + LLINs are superior to LLINs alone. Over twelve (12) months (August 2015- Aug 2016), in an area with universal coverage (UC) of LLINs and where artemisinin combination therapies (ACT) are provided as the first-line treatment of malaria, we intend to evaluate the impact of DL on malaria transmission among children ages 6 months to 11 years as measured by the incidence of malaria parasitemia (symptomatic and asymptomatic), and the prevalence of moderate to severe anemia in under-fives. In addition, we will assess the effect of DL on entomological parameters, and measure the acceptability and a cost-effectiveness of the intervention. Stratified randomization based on malaria prevalence during the baseline survey will be used to select 22 clusters per arm in Muheza district.

Preliminary data in a recently completed RCT evaluating artesunate-mefloquine vs chloroquine for P. vivax showed up to 36% P. vivax recurrence with chloroquine monotherapy by day 28 post treatment without primaquine. Based on these data, blood stage chloroquine treatment failure rates should also be evaluated in the context of standard concurrent (rather than delayed) liver stage primaquine dosing, due to both its potential blood stage synergistic effect in addition to known decreased recurrence rates. As artemether-lumefantrine is one of the current first line Ministry of Health ACTs used in Sabah with a lower adverse event profile compared to artesunate-mefloquine, this was recommended as the more appropriate ACT to evaluate against chloroquine.

However, there was limited durability of protection in a small number of protected subjects who were rechallenged several months later.
This study is designed to substantiate the initial results with the IV vaccination route for protection against CHMI. Based on the potential importance of dose and schedule in optimizing sustained immunity with this vaccine, an increase in PfSPZ IV dosage on schedules of 3 to 5 vaccinations will be evaluated for protection against CHMI conducted early (about 3 weeks) and late (about 24 weeks) after completion of vaccinations. To assess if a higher dose given by another route confers protection, one group will receive PfSPZ IM, with half of the amount administered in each arm on a schedule with 4 vaccination.
The primary objectives of the study are related to the safety and tolerability of vaccinations by the IV and IM routes of administration and protection against Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) challenge performed via a well-established CHMI procedure early (2-4 weeks) after completing schedules of 3 to 5 vaccinations. The secondary objective is related to the durability of protection at 20-26 weeks after the last vaccination and exploratory objectives are related to the immunogenicity of the PfSPZ Vaccine and identifying potential immune correlates of protection

Cluster randomised trial comparing targeted versus generalised vector control in South Africa,http://www.malariaeradication.org/mesa-track/cluster-randomised-trial-comparing-targeted-versus-generalised-vector-control-south,Project,May-14,Oct-16,South Africa,$1 408 230,"Medical Research Council (MRC), UK",,,London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM),"Immo Kleinschmidt, Chris Drakeley",,,"Countries that have reduced malaria incidence to low levels face major challenges when trying to eliminate the disease altogether. In trying to reduce transmission further, considerable resources are required for disease prevention through mosquito vector control, for example by indoor residual spraying (IRS) of all houses. 
Such mass prevention efforts can lead to reduced compliance in communities and control programs who no longer perceive a risk of malaria, and waning political and donor commitment when the disease burden is low, thereby endangering the sustainability of the elimination effort. Evidence based methods of scaling back blanket IRS have to be developed which ensure that populations are not put at risk when IRS is no longer routinely applied.
In this study, targeted focal IRS in response to new cases being reported will be compared with generalised annual IRS of all houses, to determine whether it is as effective, less costly, more acceptable, results in higher coverage and compliance and increased malaria prevention seeking behaviour. A pre-condition for this approach, is a reliable rapid malaria case surveillance system, based on definitive diagnosis of suspected cases.
 This trial will be carried out in South Africa, which has practised blanket IRS for many decades, where case incidence in many districts is now low enough to be considered pre-elimination, and where a high quality case reporting system is well established. Spray localities will be grouped into clusters of 5,000 to 10,000 persons which will be randomly allocated to either targeted IRS, or to blanket routine IRS. Targeted neighbourhood IRS will be triggered in response to two or more local cases occurring within 4 weeks of each other and residing within 0.5km from one another. 
Spraying and community awareness activities will be carried out in a radius of 0.5km from each case house. It is postulated that focal spraying will lead to higher quality of IRS application because it can be better supervised and will be seen as protection against real risk of infection due to the occurrence of recent local cases; that it will be more acceptable to householders and hence lead to better co-operation with access to premises and hence higher spray coverage; and that householders will exercise better compliance with not repainting, washing or re-plastering of walls after spraying. 
As a result we expect that incidence of cases will be no higher in targeted IRS areas than in those receiving mass IRS and that targeted spraying will be more economical and hence more sustainable. The study will measure malaria case incidence, householder acceptability and compliance, spray coverage, and economic costs of the interventions as outcome indicators.
There is some evidence from other countries that in very low transmission settings, incident malaria cases occur in hotspots that are stable over time. If such hotspots can be accurately located, they can be singled out for focal interventions such as targeted IRS at the beginning of each season. 
To investigate whether such hotspots of local transmission exist in South Africa, it is proposed that filter paper blood spots are collected in communities where targeted IRS is carried out, to be tested for the presence of antibody sero-positivity to malarial antigens. The sero-prevalence of 'outbreak' communities will be compared with sero-prevalence of randomly selected communities in which no recent cases have occurred.This comparison will determine whether neighbourhoods with recent cases have historically been exposed to malaria parasites, and are therefore likely to be hotspots of transmission. The existence of such hotspots would strengthen the case for targeted control efforts.
For countries that have set elimination of malaria as a policy objective this study will provide evidence upon which sustainable policy decisions about mass vector control can be based during the pre-elimination period.","Entomology, Operational research","Asymptomatic reservoir, Elimination strategies, Foci, Impact of interventions, Tools for elimination"

The use of ivermectin represents an important strategy if added to the arsenal of measures to control malaria. Ivermectin is expected to address important challenges for vector control of malaria: (1) its mode of action is different from the classes of insecticides currently used, bypassing the emergence of resistance to insecticides, (2) as it is a systemic drug, will be ingested by all the mosquitoes that itch, reaching also those with endo and exophageal behavior, and (3) drug activity is the main variable of vector capacity, which is the probability of daily mosquito survival. Ivermectin fits into many of the control ideals, including integrating current tools with changing population structure and extrinsic cycle of the vector, revealing its potential application as a complementary strategy in malaria control. Studies addressing the use of previously conducted oral insecticides are restricted to African vectors. This study will allow the generation of more reliable evidences and will lead to the increase of the experience of the research group in this type of methodology. The study will improve health care for patients living in areas endemic for malaria in the Amazon, contributing to the increase of indicators of health and quality of life, by allowing the use of a safe control measure and with impact on other competing health problems.

The study will be conducted in 6 months period and evaluate various parameters including malaria incidence and proportion of anemia in monthly cohort school children (in arm1, 2 and 3), in addition to malaria prevalence in the community (only in arm 1 and arm 2). All positive subject in all arms will receive supervised treatment. Secondary objectives are the proportion of gametocytemia in the community, the proportion of malaria antibody of various age groups, population genetic of local parasite, submicroscopic incidence based polymerase chain reaction and the proportion of infective mosquitoes. Data analysis will be performed according to the method for cluster randomized trial evaluation.","Operational research, Product development & clinical research","Drug-based strategies, Surveillance"

According to the ""Guidance on temporary malaria control measures in Ebola-affected countries¨ issued by WHO in November 2014, Sierra Leone MoH implemented a Mass Drug Administration (MDA) campaing that targeted more than 2.6 million people. The MDA campaign comprised 2 rounds of Amodiaquine-Artesunate (first line recommended treatment for P. falciparum in the coutry) separated by 2 weeks.
The objectives of the MDA were:
 1. Rapidly reduce malaria-related incidence and mortality rates by providing intervalled MDA using ASAQ ? targeting in 7 high burden districts and all populations (all ages including children under 5 and pregnant women);
2.  Rapidly reduce number of febrile Ebola suspected episodes that would otherwise have required screening and isolation in the Ebola suspected holding centres to exclude Ebola as the cause of illnesses; and reduce the risk of Ebola transmission among malaria patients;

Males gather over specific and conspicuous landmarks known as swarm markers to attract females, usually at dusk, and repeatedly at the same place over many years. Targeting swarms to deplete mosquito populations offers an unrivalled opportunity to drastically reduce mosquito-borne pathogen transmission. While this approach has proven effective against An. coluzzii on a limited scale in Burkina Faso, it needs to be validated for other vector species in other areas. The approach of targeting swarms with space-praying enables clear identification of the target (in this case swarms or clusters of swarms) for localized control. Besides, mosquito swarms are known to occur perpetually in the same locations at approximately the same time each day, making them easier to target once initially located. Also, while mixed swarms can occur, they are mostly consistent of same species, thus we can use this approach to very specifically target a specific vector. The concentrations of males, predictability and accessibility of the swarming sites and the fact that swarms can be artificially manipulated make them vulnerable and an easy control target. Moreover, the tight clustering of the target provides an opportunity for controlled and reduced dose space spray application over the traditional area wide or broadcast space spray.
","The main objective of this project is to demonstrate that swarms of adult malaria vectors can be readily identified and targeted with effective area wide space spraying, to crash the local vector populations and significantly lower vectorial capacities, thereby complementing and accelerating efforts towards malaria elimination in the targeted areas.","Entomology, Operational research",Measurement of transmission

In Tanzania, efforts to control malaria resulted in the halving of Plasmodium falciparum malaria prevalence in the period between 2000 and 2010. In most communities, what now remains is a significantly reduced amount of persistent residual transmission. The challenge now is that this residual transmission is no longer as responsive to the forefront malaria prevention measures as before, meaning that some additional new tools would be required to bridge the gaps and drive transmission to zero.
Disenfranchised communities, such as itinerant farming households will need to be targeted, so as to improve existing protective coverage and ensure a lower quantities of potential transmission reservoirs. The exposure free houses, if used appropriately will be essential in ensuring that even where the effectiveness of our current best preventive options is compromised, we can still provided adequate level of transmission prevention especially to the disenfranchised.
The main objective of this project is to develop a portable and low-cost mosquito- proof hut design that can protect itinerant rice farmers from infectious mosquito bites and mosquito borne illnesses, during the period when they are at their ricefields.
Specific objectives:
1. To quantify actual mosquito biting exposure in the temporary farm houses currently used by these itinerant rice farmers while out in their farms , relative to biting exposure in the main houses used in actual home villages
2. To assess views, experiences and behaviours of the itinerant rice farmers regarding mosquito borne illnesses such as malaria and their preferred options of controlling such illnesses and mosquito bites
3. Design and construct a prototype portable exposure-free hut, using durable materials available in Tanzania and technologies already developed at Ifakara Health Institute 
4 Demonstrate that the prototype exposure-free huts can reduce mosquito bites and transmission of mosquito-borne illnesses.

A first interim analysis has shown a vaccine efficacy f 55.8% (95% CI 50.6-60.4) against clinical malaria and 47.3% (95% CI 22.4-64.2) against severe malaria. Previous trials have shown that in some circumstances the duration of protection afforded by the vaccine was at least 45 months while in others it waned at 3 months. Initial results of the phase 3 interim analysis have maintained opened questions regarding the duration of vaccine- induced protection, which may be affected by differing malaria transmission intensities among trial sites. The aim is to address key gaps in the knowledge of RTS,S mode of action through the analysis of well- characterized plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples collected in the pediatric phase 3 trial. RTS,S delivered in combination with the AS adjuvant system was designed to elicit strong antibody, TH1 and cytotoxic responses to the circumsporozoite protein (CSP). However, understanding of the mechanisms of protection is only partial. Based on clinical and immunogenicity data from Phase 2 studies, a model of how protection is developed has been proposed. The study hypothesis is that long term immunity against clinical malaria depends on two distinct, but related, mechanisms: 1) initial partial pre-erythrocytic protection via induction of vaccine-specific humoral and cellular immune responses, and 2) long term immunity resulting from enhancement of blood stage immunity facilitated through partial RTS,S protection. Vaccine efficacy may also be affected by parasite-driven immune modulation such as hyporesponsive populations of memory B cells. Identification of immune correlates of protection will also accelerate the evaluation of second generation vaccines against malaria.

Background
The prospect of eliminating malaria is challenged by emerging insecticide resistance and vectors with outdoor and/or crepuscular activity. Ivermectin can simultaneously tackle these issues by killing mosquitoes feeding on treated animals and humans. A single oral dose, however, confers only short-lived mosquitocidal plasma levels.


Methods
Three different slow-release formulations of ivermectin were screened for their capacity to sustain mosquito-killing levels of ivermectin for months. Thirty rabbits received a dose of one, two or three silicone implants containing different proportions of ivermectin, deoxycholate and sucrose. Animals were checked for toxicity and ivermectin was quantified periodically in blood. Potential impact of corresponding long-lasting formulation was mathematically modelled.


Results
All combinations of formulation and dose released ivermectin for more than 12 weeks; four combinations sustained plasma levels capable of killing 50% of Anopheles gambiae feeding on a treated subject for up to 24 weeks. No major adverse effects attributable to the drug were found. Modelling predicts a 98% reduction in infectious vector density by using an ivermectin formulation with a 12-week duration.


Conclusions
These results indicate that relatively stable mosquitocidal plasma levels of ivermectin can be safely sustained in rabbits for up to six months using a silicone-based subcutaneous formulation. Modifying the formulation of ivermectin promises to be a suitable strategy for malaria vector control.

","Ivermectin (IVM) reduces mosquito survival in lab and field studies, potentially leading to a disruption in transmission. A key factor for interrupting transmission, however, would be the time IVM remains in blood above mosquito-killing levels. Current oral formulations can only maintain mosquitocidal concentrations for approximately 48 hours. In this animal model, we aimed to find a safe implantable formulation capable of sustaining mosquito-killing levels of IVM for months.","Entomology, Product development & clinical research","Measurement of transmission, Tools for elimination"

Mass drug administration with anti-malarials directed at eliminating parasites in blood, either to entire populations or targeting only those with malaria infections, are considered useful strategies to progress towards malaria elimination, but may be insufficient if applied on their own. These strategies assume a closer contact with populations, so incorporating a vector control intervention tool to those approaches could significantly enhance their efficacy. Ivermectin, an endectocide drug efficacious against a range of Anopheles species, could be added to other drug-based interventions.

Mosquito adulticides are the bedrock of effective malaria control because they are relatively cost-effective, they can be applied to walls or bednets, and they target the most critical variable in malaria transmission models, adult mosquito survivor rates. However, widespread insecticide resistance and continued malaria transmission require the development of novel adulticides and novel ways to apply them. Endectocides are broad spectrum, low toxicity drugs with combined anti-helminthic and anti-ectoparasitic properties and are currently given to human populations for onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis control. Current endectocides that act as agonists to glutamate and GABA-gated chloride ion channels in mosquito myoneural junctions, could also be effectively used for malaria control in sub- Saharan Africa and would have certain major advantages over other adulticides due to their molecular targets, how they would be administered to the human population, and the bionomics of African malaria vectors. 
","This project seeks to develop novel methods to control malaria in sub-Saharan Africa by evaluating current anti-helminth drugs for activity against African malaria vectors and testing their effects in a natural field experiment.

Malaria accounts for the largest portion of global mosquito-borne disease morbidity and mortality. There is an urgent need for novel vector control tools that reduce malaria transmission by mosquitoes in distinct ways from traditional insecticides, including tools that have new molecular targets in mosquitoes, new modes of delivery to the mosquito, and tools that can target transmission by vectors not well- controlled by insecticide-treated nets or indoor residual spraying. To be maximally effective in resource- constrained environments of the developing world, such tools must also be able to integrate with existing malaria control interventions and existing human health infrastructures. The main hypothesis is that ivermectin used in human de-worming campaigns in African villages, and which can disrupt malaria parasite transmission in Senegalese villages, could serve as one of these promising new tools. Ivermectin is an oral drug, already given by mass administration to humans in the developing world for onchocerciasis control, and malaria vectors can ingest and be killed by this drug when they bite humans after these mass drug administrations. The data suggests that more frequent administrations of ivermectin in malaria-endemic communities would result in sustained reductions in malaria parasite transmission. To get to this goal, a thorough examination of the ivermectin effects against malaria vectors in the field and laboratory is necessary.

Ivermectin is a broad spectrum antiparasitic endectocide clinically used for onchocerciasis and lymphatic filariasis control at single doses of 150 to 200 mcg/kg. It also shortens the lifespan of mosquitoes that feed on individuals recently treated with ivermectin. However, the effect after a 150 to 200 mcg/kg oral dose is short-lived (6 to 11 days). Modeling suggests higher doses, which prolong the mosquitocidal effects, are needed to make a significant contribution to malaria elimination. Ivermectin has a wide therapeutic index and previous studies have shown doses up to 2000 mcg/kg (ie, 10 times the US Food and Drug Administration approved dose) are well tolerated and safe; the highest dose used for onchocerciasis is a single dose of 800 mcg/kg.
","The aim of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ivermectin doses of 0, 300, and 600 mcg/kg/day for 3 days, when provided with a standard 3-day course of the antimalarial dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP), on mosquito survival.
The secondary objectives of the study are (1) to determine the effect of different doses of ivermectin on oocyst development; (2) to determine the pharmacokinetic profile of the different ivermectin regimens; (3) to determine if ivermectin interacts with the pharmacokinetics of piperaquine; (4) to determine whether the addition of ivermectin to DP affects the clinical and parasitological response to DP treatment; (5) to determine the role of genetic variants of CYP3A4 activity in metabolizing ivermectin; and (6) to determine the effect of direct feeding versus membrane feeding on mosquito survival.","Entomology, Product development & clinical research","Drug-based strategies, Impact of interventions, Tools for elimination"

A common theme of this proposal is to identify genetic variation in the malaria parasite, vector and human host and relate this genetic variation to understanding malaria transmission and development of effective malaria control measures. Whole genome approaches for both the parasite and vector will provide genetic variation Information necessary to discover signals associated with drug resistance in the parasite and insecticide resistance in the mosquito. Genotyping specific loci related to drug resistance in the parasite, insecticide resistance in the vector, and hemoglobin or other human loci associated with malaria outcome, will inform the effectiveness of interventions directed at reducing malaria disease burden. Genotyping assays to identify parasite types in patient samples or vector types will be developed to track changes in these populations as intervention strategies are applied at the study sites.
The genotyping core will provide sequencing and genotyping resources, as well as analysis resources to determine the most informative markers in these populations related to intervention response and disease outcome.
The Genomics Core will validate these markers and develop field-deployable assays that are low-cost and easy to Implement for tracking malaria outcomes as intervention strategies toward the eradication of malaria are applied.
A central component of the shared resources Genomics Core will involve training disease endemic country scientists how to leverage genomic sequence and genotyping data for both discovery and tool development. As community-wide efforts increase the amount of publically available sequencing and genotyping data for the malaria parasite, the anopheles vector, and the human host, an opportunity for capacity building and technology transfer will be the development of skills necessary to analyze sequence and genotyping data and apply population genetic approaches to glean important signals from these data to assist with malaria control measures and surveillance.

To accomplish those goals, the administrative core (core A) has been organized in four specific aims:
Track scientific progress and accomplishments for each of the individual projects and cores,
Identify and ensure the coordination of related studies at different field sites,
Ensure compliance with IRBs and other regulatory authorities for studies of human subjects, and
Develop administrative guidelines (including subcontracts) to define the responsibilities of investigators, and to ensure the responsible management of funds.
The first objective is to track progress on the Milestones and Timelines developed by the individual projects and cores. This will be accomplished using a combination of electronic (WEB-based) communications, conference calls, site visits, face-to-face meetings, regional scientific interchanges and short-term training. The rationale for the second objective is that the identification of common (shared) successes and obstacles among field sites is an important justification for this RFA to develop International Centers of Excellence for Malaria Research. The rationale for the third objective is that the enormous number of guidelines and authorities which regulate the performance human studies is a potential obstacle to the success of these studies. This issue will be addressed by hiring a Compliance Officer within the administrative core and by providing similar staff support at each of the participating sites. The rationale for the fourth objective is that the management of funds is more difficult with international projects. That challenge will be addressed by providing support to ensure the timely transfers of funds among institutions, by electronic reporting of expenditures, and by drawing on templates that have been used successfully in the past for subcontracts.
The long-term objectives of the administrative core are to:
develop expertise in research administration within West and Central Africa,
provide regional leadership on administrative issues related to health research and
provide a foundation to move from capacity building (training of individuals) to the development of research institutions and networks.
