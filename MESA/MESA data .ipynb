established potential to reduce the incidence of vector-borne diseases. There is evidence that several avermectins inhibit the hepatic stage of Plasmodium infection in vitro. Notably, ivermectin potently inhibits liver infection in vivo by impairing parasite development inside hepatocytes. This impairment has a clear impact on the ensuing blood stage parasitemia, reducing disease severity and enhancing host survival. Ivermectin has been proposed as a tool to control malaria transmission because of its effects on the mosquito vector.

scourges, such as malaria, are limited by the logistic challenges of reaching large rural populations and ensuring patient adherence to adequate pharmacologic treatment. This team has generated long-acting formulations for controlled release of ivermectin, a drug that targets malaria-transmitting mosquitoes. Further, by using mathematical models of malaria transmission that incorporate the lethal effect of ivermectin against malaria-transmitting mosquitoes, they have demonstrated that this system will boost the efficacy of mass drug administration toward malaria elimination goals. Encapsulated, gastric-resident dosage forms for ultra?long-acting drug delivery have the potential to revolutionize treatment options for malaria and other diseases that affect large populations around the globe for which treatment adherence is essential for efficacy.\n",

Recent research indicates that IVM could potentially be used in malaria vector control.\n",
       "The present study assesses the pharmacokinetic profile of IVM in healthy human volunteers and aims to create a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model. This model will be used to characterize enterohepatic circulation, serve as a basis for drug-drug and drug-disease-state interaction studies, and simulations of IVM disposition in different populations, with special regard given to adolescents and children. With this, safety in individual administrations can be increased, and mass drug administration programs, e.g. oral IVM as malaria vector control, be simulated and planned to maximize the share of a population that can be included. Capillary blood concentration profiles will also be determined to assess the amount of IVM delivered to mosquitos in malaria vector control programs. Furthermore, this study will validate dried blood spot analytics of IVM which will allow easier procurement of pharmacokinetics (PK) data in the field.\n",

       "Overview Study Design: Single-blind (outcomes assessor); parallel assignment with 2 arms; cluster-randomized control trial to determine the effect of repeated IVM MDA on malaria transmission and clinical malaria episodes. The unit of randomization will be the village (cluster). 8 villages total will be enrolled in two arms. The active comparator arm (4 villages) will receive a single standard MDA (IVM; 150-200 &lt;U+00B5&gt;g/kg + albendazole; 400 mg) soon after the start of the rainy season, while the experimental arm (4 villages) will receive the standard MDA on the same date, plus 5 more IVM MDA at 3 week intervals thereafter. The primary endpoint will be the cumulative incidence of clinical malaria episodes in children ?5 year of age within each village.\n",

transmission is curbed by effective vector control with indoor tools (LLINs and IRS), drug-based strategies and economic development, the relative importance of residual transmission increases. This poses a serious threat to reaching elimination goals. Mass administration of ivermectin (a drug capable of targeting malaria vectors regardless of time and place of biting) has gained increased attention by funders, academia and international organizations as a potential complementary tool for malaria elimination. There is now clear WHO guidance on the Preferred Product Characteristics for such a tool and a draft Target Candidate Profile by Medicines for Malaria Venture.&lt;U+00A0&gt; Still, the malaria community lacks alignment on the processes needed to transform the potential of ivermectin into an implemented tool. This project aims at producing a roadmap for such transformation including key issues to be resolved (dose, regimen, eligibility, regulatory pathway), go/no-go criteria along the evaluation and development process. For this, the ivermectin taskforce, a group of experts and stakeholders will work on complementary streams to produce a roadmap document and accompanying TPPs that can guide related investments and efforts.\n",

          </td><td><span style=white-space:pre-wrap>Malaria is a major health problem throughout the tropical world and is transmitted by a variety of Anopheles mosquitoes. Core vector control interventions consist of indoor residual spraying of insecticides and long- lasting insecticidal nets. These are logical strategies in areas where the primary vector species feed at night on people sleeping in their houses and where mosquitoes rest inside the house after blood-feeding. But in Central America, much of the malaria transmission is due to malaria vectors that are exophagic (i.e., prefer to bite outdoors), exophilic (i.e., prefer to remain outdoors), and zoophaghic (i.e., as likely to feed on non-humans as humans). To control mosquitoes with these behavioral characteristics requires a different approach. This proposal addresses the control of zoophagic vectors. Endectocides are chemicals that are widely used in the livestock industry to control parasites such as intestinal nematodes, ticks, mange mites, lice, and cattle grub. When ingested by mosquitoes in a bloodmeal, endectocides have also been shown to reduce the survival and fecundity of Anopheles malaria vectors. Use of endectocides in peridomestic livestock may simultaneously hasten malaria eradication, control ticks, and boost feed-conversion for livestock in Central America.&lt;U+00A0&gt;\n",

Additional interventions beyond those currently available are needed to eliminate the disease. One strategy with increasing support is addition of ivermectin, a well-known and safe drug used for treating onchocerciasis and other diseases, to current mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns with artemisinin regimens. Ivermectin has a unique activity in interrupting malaria transmission in endemic areas by reducing the life expectancy of the vector Anopheles mosquitos that bite subjects who have ivermectin in their blood. Modelling, as well as proof of concept field studies, have shown that long (10 plus day) courses of small doses of ivermectin, in combination with short courses of currently used artemisinin combination MDA, have the potential to reduce the efficiency of malaria transmission, reduce malaria cases, and potentially lead to disease elimination. Treating even 50% of the population in this way can reduce disease transmission to levels that can protect the whole population, including children under 5 most at risk. To be effective, repeat dosing every three days would currently be necessary, limiting feasibility. Development of an ultra long-acting oral ivermectin formulation that achieves single dose administration and prolonged low level blood exposure could dramatically change current treatment options, reduce malaria morbidity and potentiate malaria elimination efforts. No existing oral delivery system can prolong therapeutic blood levels for small molecules therapeutics beyond 12-24 hours. Prototype oral capsules based on Lyndra's gastric residence technology have been developed, and can achieve 7-14 days of sustained therapeutic ivermectin levels in a pig model and have shown similar efficacy with other drugs in multiple large animal models.\n",
       "</td><td>The goal of this grant is to develop an optimal ivermectin dosage form that 1) achieves consistent and efficacious blood levels of ivermectin for 14 days from a single dose administration, 2) develop a reproducible and scalable low cost manufacturing capability, and 3) evaluate these dosage forms with respect to pharmacokinetics and gastric retention in beagle dogs. Formulations will be developed to pharmaceutical grade standards of in vitro release and stability under Tropical Zone 4b standards. Methods of production compatible with low cost of goods production and scale will be prototyped. Dosage forms will be evaluated in extensive preclinical pharmacology studies in beagles, including stress conditions, and a toxicology study will be performed. This grant will deliver a product ready for IND-enabling studies and create capability for GMP production of clinical specimens for a phase 1 human pharmacokinetic (PK) study of ultra long-acting Lyndra-Ivermectin.&lt;U+00A0&gt;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </td><td>Product development &amp; clinical research                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </td><td>Drug-based strategies, Tools for elimination                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               </td></tr>\n",

Avermectins are powerful endectocides with an established potential to reduce the incidence of vector-borne diseases. There is evidence that several avermectins inhibit the hepatic stage of Plasmodium infection in vitro. Notably, ivermectin potently inhibits liver infection in vivo by impairing parasite development inside hepatocytes. This impairment has a clear impact on the ensuing blood stage parasitemia, reducing disease severity and enhancing host survival. Ivermectin has been proposed as a tool to control malaria transmission because of its effects on the mosquito vector. This study extends the effect of ivermectin to the early stages of mammalian host infection and supports the inclusion of this multipurpose drug in malaria control strategies.\n",

malaria, are limited by the logistic challenges of reaching large rural populations and ensuring patient adherence to adequate pharmacologic treatment. This team has generated long-acting formulations for controlled release of ivermectin, a drug that targets malaria-transmitting mosquitoes. Further, by using mathematical models of malaria transmission that incorporate the lethal effect of ivermectin against malaria-transmitting mosquitoes, they have demonstrated that this system will boost the efficacy of mass drug administration toward malaria elimination goals. Encapsulated, gastric-resident dosage forms for ultra?long-acting drug delivery have the potential to revolutionize treatment options for malaria and other diseases that affect large populations around the globe for which treatment adherence is essential for efficacy.\n",

Ivermectin (IVM) is a broad spectrum antiparasitic drug. Recent research indicates that IVM could potentially be used in malaria vector control.\n",
       "The present study assesses the pharmacokinetic profile of IVM in healthy human volunteers and aims to create a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model. This model will be used to characterize enterohepatic circulation, serve as a basis for drug-drug and drug-disease-state interaction studies, and simulations of IVM disposition in different populations, with special regard given to adolescents and children. With this, safety in individual administrations can be increased, and mass drug administration programs, e.g. oral IVM as malaria vector control, be simulated and planned to maximize the share of a population that can be included. Capillary blood concentration profiles will also be determined to assess the amount of IVM delivered to mosquitos in malaria vector control programs.

       "Overview Study Design: Single-blind (outcomes assessor); parallel assignment with 2 arms; cluster-randomized control trial to determine the effect of repeated IVM MDA on malaria transmission and clinical malaria episodes. The unit of randomization will be the village (cluster). 8 villages total will be enrolled in two arms. The active comparator arm (4 villages) will receive a single standard MDA (IVM; 150-200 <U+00B5>g/kg + albendazole; 400 mg) soon after the start of the rainy season, while the experimental arm (4 villages) will receive the standard MDA on the same date, plus 5 more IVM MDA at 3 week intervals thereafter. The primary endpoint will be the cumulative incidence of clinical malaria episodes in children ?5 year of age within each village.\n",

As malaria transmission is curbed by effective vector control with indoor tools (LLINs and IRS), drug-based strategies and economic development, the relative importance of residual transmission increases. This poses a serious threat to reaching elimination goals. Mass administration of ivermectin (a drug capable of targeting malaria vectors regardless of time and place of biting) has gained increased attention by funders, academia and international organizations as a potential complementary tool for malaria elimination. There is now clear WHO guidance on the Preferred Product Characteristics for such a tool and a draft Target Candidate Profile by Medicines for Malaria Venture.<U+00A0> Still, the malaria community lacks alignment on the processes needed to transform the potential of ivermectin into an implemented tool. This project aims at producing a roadmap for such transformation including key issues to be resolved (dose, regimen, eligibility, regulatory pathway), go/no-go criteria along the evaluation and development process. For this, the ivermectin taskforce, a group of experts and stakeholders will work on complementary streams to produce a roadmap document and accompanying TPPs that can guide related investments and efforts.\n",

is transmitted by a variety of Anopheles mosquitoes. Core vector control interventions consist of indoor residual spraying of insecticides and long- lasting insecticidal nets. These are logical strategies in areas where the primary vector species feed at night on people sleeping in their houses and where mosquitoes rest inside the house after blood-feeding. But in Central America, much of the malaria transmission is due to malaria vectors that are exophagic (i.e., prefer to bite outdoors), exophilic (i.e., prefer to remain outdoors), and zoophaghic (i.e., as likely to feed on non-humans as humans). To control mosquitoes with these behavioral characteristics requires a different approach. This proposal addresses the control of zoophagic vectors. Endectocides are chemicals that are widely used in the livestock industry to control parasites such as intestinal nematodes, ticks, mange mites, lice, and cattle grub. When ingested by mosquitoes in a bloodmeal, endectocides have also been shown to reduce the survival and fecundity of Anopheles malaria vectors. Use of endectocides in peridomestic livestock may simultaneously hasten malaria eradication, control ticks, and boost feed-conversion for livestock in Central America.<U+00A0>\n",

Because zoophagic vectors are responsible for much of the malaria transmission in Central America, malaria transmission will be reduced in areas where endectocides are given to livestock.\n",

Additional interventions beyond those currently available are needed to eliminate the disease. One strategy with increasing support is addition of ivermectin, a well-known and safe drug used for treating onchocerciasis and other diseases, to current mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns with artemisinin regimens. Ivermectin has a unique activity in interrupting malaria transmission in endemic areas by reducing the life expectancy of the vector Anopheles mosquitos that bite subjects who have ivermectin in their blood. Modelling, as well as proof of concept field studies, have shown that long (10 plus day) courses of small doses of ivermectin, in combination with short courses of currently used artemisinin combination MDA, have the potential to reduce the efficiency of malaria transmission, reduce malaria cases, and potentially lead to disease elimination. Treating even 50\\% of the population in this way can reduce disease transmission to levels that can protect the whole population, including children under 5 most at risk. To be effective, repeat dosing every three days would currently be necessary, limiting feasibility. Development of an ultra long-acting oral ivermectin formulation that achieves single dose administration and prolonged low level blood exposure could dramatically change current treatment options, reduce malaria morbidity and potentiate malaria elimination efforts. No existing oral delivery system can prolong therapeutic blood levels for small molecules therapeutics beyond 12-24 hours. Prototype oral capsules based on Lyndra's gastric residence technology have been developed, and can achieve 7-14 days of sustained therapeutic ivermectin levels in a pig model and have shown similar efficacy with other drugs in multiple large animal models.\n",
       " & The goal of this grant is to develop an optimal ivermectin dosage form that 1) achieves consistent and efficacious blood levels of ivermectin for 14 days from a single dose administration, 2) develop a reproducible and scalable low cost manufacturing capability, and 3) evaluate these dosage forms with respect to pharmacokinetics and gastric retention in beagle dogs. Formulations will be developed to pharmaceutical grade standards of in vitro release and stability under Tropical Zone 4b standards. Methods of production compatible with low cost of goods production and scale will be prototyped. Dosage forms will be evaluated in extensive preclinical pharmacology studies in beagles, including stress conditions, and a toxicology study will be performed. This grant will deliver a product ready for IND-enabling studies and create capability for GMP production of clinical specimens for a phase 1 human pharmacokinetic (PK) study of ultra long-acting Lyndra-Ivermectin.<U+00A0>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         & Product development \\& clinical research                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     & Drug-based strategies, Tools for elimination                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \\\\\n",

Avermectins are powerful endectocides with an established potential to reduce the incidence of vector-borne diseases. There is evidence that several avermectins inhibit the hepatic stage of Plasmodium infection in vitro. Notably, ivermectin potently inhibits liver infection in vivo by impairing parasite development inside hepatocytes. This impairment has a clear impact on the ensuing blood stage parasitemia, reducing disease severity and enhancing host survival. Ivermectin has been proposed as a tool to control malaria transmission because of its effects on the mosquito vector. This study extends the effect of ivermectin to the early stages of mammalian host infection and supports the inclusion of this multipurpose drug in malaria control strategies.\n",

malaria, are limited by the logistic challenges of reaching large rural populations and ensuring patient adherence to adequate pharmacologic treatment. This team has generated long-acting formulations for controlled release of ivermectin, a drug that targets malaria-transmitting mosquitoes. Further, by using mathematical models of malaria transmission that incorporate the lethal effect of ivermectin against malaria-transmitting mosquitoes, they have demonstrated that this system will boost the efficacy of mass drug administration toward malaria elimination goals. Encapsulated, gastric-resident dosage forms for ultra?long-acting drug delivery have the potential to revolutionize treatment options for malaria and other diseases that affect large populations around the globe for which treatment adherence is essential for efficacy.\n",

Ivermectin (IVM) is a broad spectrum antiparasitic drug. Recent research indicates that IVM could potentially be used in malaria vector control.\n",
       "The present study assesses the pharmacokinetic profile of IVM in healthy human volunteers and aims to create a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model. This model will be used to characterize enterohepatic circulation, serve as a basis for drug-drug and drug-disease-state interaction studies, and simulations of IVM disposition in different populations, with special regard given to adolescents and children. With this, safety in individual administrations can be increased, and mass drug administration programs, e.g. oral IVM as malaria vector control, be simulated and planned to maximize the share of a population that can be included. Capillary blood concentration profiles will also be determined to assess the amount of IVM delivered to mosquitos in malaria vector control programs.

     | Hypothesis: Repeated IVM MDA starting at the beginning of the rainy season will be well tolerated and safe, and will reduce clinical malaria episodes in children by significantly reducing malaria transmission among treated villages.\n",
       "Overview Study Design: Single-blind (outcomes assessor); parallel assignment with 2 arms; cluster-randomized control trial to determine the effect of repeated IVM MDA on malaria transmission and clinical malaria episodes. The unit of randomization will be the village (cluster). 8 villages total will be enrolled in two arms. The active comparator arm (4 villages) will receive a single standard MDA (IVM; 150-200 <U+00B5>g/kg + albendazole; 400 mg) soon after the start of the rainy season, while the experimental arm (4 villages) will receive the standard MDA on the same date, plus 5 more IVM MDA at 3 week intervals thereafter. The primary endpoint will be the cumulative incidence of clinical malaria episodes in children ?5 year of age within each village.\n",

As malaria transmission is curbed by effective vector control with indoor tools (LLINs and IRS), drug-based strategies and economic development, the relative importance of residual transmission increases. This poses a serious threat to reaching elimination goals. Mass administration of ivermectin (a drug capable of targeting malaria vectors regardless of time and place of biting) has gained increased attention by funders, academia and international organizations as a potential complementary tool for malaria elimination. There is now clear WHO guidance on the Preferred Product Characteristics for such a tool and a draft Target Candidate Profile by Medicines for Malaria Venture.<U+00A0> Still, the malaria community lacks alignment on the processes needed to transform the potential of ivermectin into an implemented tool. This project aims at producing a roadmap for such transformation including key issues to be resolved (dose, regimen, eligibility, regulatory pathway), go/no-go criteria along the evaluation and development process. For this, the ivermectin taskforce, a group of experts and stakeholders will work on complementary streams to produce a roadmap document and accompanying TPPs that can guide related investments and efforts.\n",

is transmitted by a variety of Anopheles mosquitoes. Core vector control interventions consist of indoor residual spraying of insecticides and long- lasting insecticidal nets. These are logical strategies in areas where the primary vector species feed at night on people sleeping in their houses and where mosquitoes rest inside the house after blood-feeding. But in Central America, much of the malaria transmission is due to malaria vectors that are exophagic (i.e., prefer to bite outdoors), exophilic (i.e., prefer to remain outdoors), and zoophaghic (i.e., as likely to feed on non-humans as humans). To control mosquitoes with these behavioral characteristics requires a different approach. This proposal addresses the control of zoophagic vectors. Endectocides are chemicals that are widely used in the livestock industry to control parasites such as intestinal nematodes, ticks, mange mites, lice, and cattle grub. When ingested by mosquitoes in a bloodmeal, endectocides have also been shown to reduce the survival and fecundity of Anopheles malaria vectors. Use of endectocides in peridomestic livestock may simultaneously hasten malaria eradication, control ticks, and boost feed-conversion for livestock in Central America.<U+00A0>\n",

Because zoophagic vectors are responsible for much of the malaria transmission in Central America, malaria transmission will be reduced in areas where endectocides are given to livestock.\n",

Additional interventions beyond those currently available are needed to eliminate the disease. One strategy with increasing support is addition of ivermectin, a well-known and safe drug used for treating onchocerciasis and other diseases, to current mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns with artemisinin regimens. Ivermectin has a unique activity in interrupting malaria transmission in endemic areas by reducing the life expectancy of the vector Anopheles mosquitos that bite subjects who have ivermectin in their blood. Modelling, as well as proof of concept field studies, have shown that long (10 plus day) courses of small doses of ivermectin, in combination with short courses of currently used artemisinin combination MDA, have the potential to reduce the efficiency of malaria transmission, reduce malaria cases, and potentially lead to disease elimination. Treating even 50% of the population in this way can reduce disease transmission to levels that can protect the whole population, including children under 5 most at risk. To be effective, repeat dosing every three days would currently be necessary, limiting feasibility. Development of an ultra long-acting oral ivermectin formulation that achieves single dose administration and prolonged low level blood exposure could dramatically change current treatment options, reduce malaria morbidity and potentiate malaria elimination efforts. No existing oral delivery system can prolong therapeutic blood levels for small molecules therapeutics beyond 12-24 hours. Prototype oral capsules based on Lyndra's gastric residence technology have been developed, and can achieve 7-14 days of sustained therapeutic ivermectin levels in a pig model and have shown similar efficacy with other drugs in multiple large animal models.\n",
       " | The goal of this grant is to develop an optimal ivermectin dosage form that 1) achieves consistent and efficacious blood levels of ivermectin for 14 days from a single dose administration, 2) develop a reproducible and scalable low cost manufacturing capability, and 3) evaluate these dosage forms with respect to pharmacokinetics and gastric retention in beagle dogs. Formulations will be developed to pharmaceutical grade standards of in vitro release and stability under Tropical Zone 4b standards. Methods of production compatible with low cost of goods production and scale will be prototyped. Dosage forms will be evaluated in extensive preclinical pharmacology studies in beagles, including stress conditions, and a toxicology study will be performed. This grant will deliver a product ready for IND-enabling studies and create capability for GMP production of clinical specimens for a phase 1 human pharmacokinetic (PK) study of ultra long-acting Lyndra-Ivermectin.<U+00A0>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Product development & clinical research                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Drug-based strategies, Tools for elimination                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | \n",

       "2  Avermectins are powerful endectocides with an established potential to reduce the incidence of vector-borne diseases. There is evidence that several avermectins inhibit the hepatic stage of Plasmodium infection in vitro. Notably, ivermectin potently inhibits liver infection in vivo by impairing parasite development inside hepatocytes. This impairment has a clear impact on the ensuing blood stage parasitemia, reducing disease severity and enhancing host survival. Ivermectin has been proposed as a tool to control malaria transmission because of its effects on the mosquito vector.

This team has generated long-acting formulations for controlled release of ivermectin, a drug that targets malaria-transmitting mosquitoes. Further, by using mathematical models of malaria transmission that incorporate the lethal effect of ivermectin against malaria-transmitting mosquitoes, they have demonstrated that this system will boost the efficacy of mass drug administration toward malaria elimination goals. Encapsulated, gastric-resident dosage forms for ultra?long-acting drug delivery have the potential to revolutionize treatment options for malaria and other diseases that affect large populations around the globe for which treatment adherence is essential for efficacy.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

Recent research indicates that IVM could potentially be used in malaria vector control.\\nThe present study assesses the pharmacokinetic profile of IVM in healthy human volunteers and aims to create a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model. This model will be used to characterize enterohepatic circulation, serve as a basis for drug-drug and drug-disease-state interaction studies, and simulations of IVM disposition in different populations, with special regard given to adolescents and children. With this, safety in individual administrations can be increased, and mass drug administration programs, e.g. oral IVM as malaria vector control, be simulated and planned to maximize the share of a population that can be included. Capillary blood concentration profiles will also be determined to assess the amount of IVM delivered to mosquitos in malaria vector control programs. Furthermore, this study will validate dried blood spot analytics of IVM which will allow easier procurement of pharmacokinetics (PK) data in the field.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "6  As malaria transmission is curbed by effective vector control with indoor tools (LLINs and IRS), drug-based strategies and economic development, the relative importance of residual transmission increases. This poses a serious threat to reaching elimination goals.

       "7  Malaria is a major health problem throughout the tropical world and is transmitted by a variety of Anopheles mosquitoes. Core vector control interventions consist of indoor residual spraying of insecticides and long- lasting insecticidal nets. These are logical strategies in areas where the primary vector species feed at night on people sleeping in their houses and where mosquitoes rest inside the house after blood-feeding. But in Central America, much of the malaria transmission is due to malaria vectors that are exophagic (i.e., prefer to bite outdoors), exophilic (i.e., prefer to remain outdoors), and zoophaghic (i.e., as likely to feed on non-humans as humans). To control mosquitoes with these behavioral characteristics requires a different approach. This proposal addresses the control of zoophagic vectors. Endectocides are chemicals that are widely used in the livestock industry to control parasites such as intestinal nematodes, ticks, mange mites, lice, and cattle grub. When ingested by mosquitoes in a bloodmeal, endectocides have also been shown to reduce the survival and fecundity of Anopheles malaria vectors. Use of endectocides in peridomestic livestock may simultaneously hasten malaria eradication, control ticks, and boost feed-conversion for livestock in Central America.<U+00A0>\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "8  Despite effective treatments, malaria remains a scourge of sub-Saharan Africa. Additional interventions beyond those currently available are needed to eliminate the disease. One strategy with increasing support is addition of ivermectin, a well-known and safe drug used for treating onchocerciasis and other diseases, to current mass drug administration (MDA) campaigns with artemisinin regimens. Ivermectin has a unique activity in interrupting malaria transmission in endemic areas by reducing the life expectancy of the vector Anopheles mosquitos that bite subjects who have ivermectin in their blood. Modelling, as well as proof of concept field studies, have shown that long (10 plus day) courses of small doses of ivermectin, in combination with short courses of currently used artemisinin combination MDA, have the potential to reduce the efficiency of malaria transmission, reduce malaria cases, and potentially lead to disease elimination. Treating even 50% of the population in this way can reduce disease transmission to levels that can protect the whole population, including children under 5 most at risk. To be effective, repeat dosing every three days would currently be necessary, limiting feasibility. Development of an ultra long-acting oral ivermectin formulation that achieves single dose administration and prolonged low level blood exposure could dramatically change current treatment options, reduce malaria morbidity and potentiate malaria elimination efforts. No existing oral delivery system can prolong therapeutic blood levels for small molecules therapeutics beyond 12-24 hours. Prototype oral capsules based on Lyndra's gastric residence technology have been developed, and can achieve 7-14 days of sustained therapeutic ivermectin levels in a pig model and have shown similar efficacy with other drugs in multiple large animal models.\\n\n",

Formulations will be developed to pharmaceutical grade standards of in vitro release and stability under Tropical Zone 4b standards. Methods of production compatible with low cost of goods production and scale will be prototyped. Dosage forms will be evaluated in extensive preclinical pharmacology studies in beagles, including stress conditions, and a toxicology study will be performed.
